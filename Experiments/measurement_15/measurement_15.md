Group Predicates that belong together + rdf_type splitted (SO MEASUREMENT 12 + GROUPING PREDICATES TOGETHER)

I couldn't group some predicates as they only appear with graphs that already has a lot of triples like rdf:type, title and so on.

modified these queries : $VSC_DATA/new_queries_named_graph_predicated_grouped :  3,5,9,17,20,23,24,25,28,34,35,38,44,47,48,50,51,52,53
