 emph{Lifted} RDT based capacity analysis of the 1-hidden layer treelike emph{sign} perceptrons neural networks                                                                                  We consider the memorization capabilities of multilayered emph{sign} perceptrons neural networks (SPNNs). A recent rigorous upper-bounding capacity characterization, obtained in cite{Stojnictcmspnncaprdt23} utilizing the Random Duality Theory (RDT), demonstrated that adding neurons in a network configuration may indeed be very beneficial. Moreover, for particular emph{treelike committee machines} (TCM) architectures with $d leq 5$ neurons in the hidden layer, cite{Stojnictcmspnncaprdt23} made a very first mathematically rigorous progress in over 30 years by lowering the previously best known capacity bounds of cite{MitchDurb89}. Here, we first establish that the RDT bounds from cite{Stojnictcmspnncaprdt23} scale as $ sim sqrt{d}$ and can not on their own emph{universally} (over the entire range of $d$) beat the best known $ sim log(d)$ scaling of the bounds from cite{MitchDurb89}. After recognizing that the progress from cite{Stojnictcmspnncaprdt23} is therefore promising, but yet without a complete concretization, we then proceed by considering the recently developed fully lifted RDT (fl RDT) as an alternative. While the fl RDT is indeed a powerful juggernaut, it typically relies on heavy numerical evaluations. To avoid such heavy numerics, we here focus on a simplified, emph{partially lifted}, variant and show that it allows for very neat, closed form, analytical capacity characterizations. Moreover, we obtain the concrete capacity bounds that emph{universally} improve for emph{any} $d$ over the best known ones of cite{MitchDurb89}.

#ContextMatters: Advantages and Limitations of Using Machine Learning to Support Women in Politics                                                                                  The United Nations identified gender equality as a Sustainable Development Goal in 2015, recognizing the underrepresentation of women in politics as a specific barrier to achieving gender equality. Political systems around the world experience gender inequality across all levels of elected government as fewer women run for office than men. This is due in part to online abuse, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter, where women seeking or in power tend to be targeted with more toxic maltreatment than their male counterparts. In this paper, we present reflections on ParityBOT - the first natural language processing-based intervention designed to affect online discourse for women in politics for the better, at scale. Deployed across elections in Canada, the United States and New Zealand, ParityBOT was used to analyse and classify more than 12 million tweets directed at women candidates and counter toxic tweets with supportive ones. From these elections we present three case studies highlighting the current limitations of, and future research and application opportunities for, using a natural language processing-based system to detect online toxicity, specifically with regards to contextually important microaggressions. We examine the rate of false negatives, where ParityBOT failed to pick up on insults directed at specific high profile women, which would be obvious to human users. We examine the unaddressed harms of microaggressions and the potential of yet unseen damage they cause for women in these communities, and for progress towards gender equality overall, in light of these technological blindspots. This work concludes with a discussion on the benefits of partnerships between nonprofit social groups and technology experts to develop responsible, socially impactful approaches to addressing online hate.

This work concludes with a discussion on the benefits of partnerships between nonprofit social groups and technology experts to develop responsible, socially impactful approaches to addressing online hate.

#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning                                                                                  Count-based exploration algorithms are known to perform near-optimally when used in conjunction with tabular reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solving small discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is generally thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state spaces, since most states will only occur once. Recent deep RL exploration strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces through complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. In this work, we describe a surprising finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous deep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes, which allows to count their occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a reward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find that simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many challenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that a domain-dependent learned hash code may further improve these results. Detailed analysis reveals important aspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2) encoding information relevant to solving the MDP. This exploration strategy achieves near state-of-the-art performance on both continuous control tasks and Atari 2600 games, hence providing a simple yet powerful baseline for solving MDPs that require considerable exploration.

The dataset consists of tweets that are humorous responses to a given hashtag. We describe the motivation for this new dataset, as well as the collection process, which includes a description of our semi-automated system for data collection. We also present initial experiments for this dataset using both unsupervised and supervised approaches. Our best supervised system achieved 63.7% accuracy, suggesting that this task is much more difficult than comparable humor detection tasks. Initial experiments indicate that a character-level model is more suitable for this task than a token-level model, likely due to a large amount of puns that can be captured by a character-level model.

#HowYouTagTweets: Learning User Hashtagging Preferences via Personalized Topic Attention                                                                                  Millions of hashtags are created on social media every day to cross-refer messages concerning similar topics. To help people find the topics they want to discuss, this paper characterizes a user’s hashtagging preferences via predicting how likely they will post with a hashtag. It is hypothesized that one’s interests in a hashtag are related with what they said before (user history) and the existing posts present the hashtag (hashtag contexts). These factors are married in the deep semantic space built with a pre-trained BERT and a neural topic model via multitask learning. In this way, user interests learned from the past can be customized to match future hashtags, which is beyond the capability of existing methods assuming unchanged hashtag semantics. Furthermore, we propose a novel personalized topic attention to capture salient contents to personalize hashtag contexts. Experiments on a large-scale Twitter dataset show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation approach without exploiting latent topics.

#phramacovigilance - Exploring Deep Learning Techniques for Identifying Mentions of Medication Intake from Twitter                                                                                  Mining social media messages for health and drug related information has received significant interest in pharmacovigilance research. Social media sites (e.g., Twitter), have been used for monitoring drug abuse, adverse reactions of drug usage and analyzing expression of sentiments related to drugs. Most of these studies are based on aggregated results from a large population rather than specific sets of individuals.

We show that in such situations, the use of the nearest neighbor search on top of the network output allows to improve the results considerably and to account for the underfitting effect during the neural network training.

While the benefits of the skew in $ textrm{JS}^{ textrm{G}_{ alpha}}$ are clear---balancing forward/reverse KL in a comprehensible manner---the choice of optimal skew remains opaque and requires an expensive grid search. In this paper we introduce $ alpha$-VAEs, which extend the $ textrm{JS}^{ textrm{G}_{ alpha}}$ variational autoencoder by allowing for learnable, and therefore data-dependent, skew. We motivate the use of a parameterised skew in the dual divergence by analysing trends dependent on data complexity in synthetic examples. We also prove and discuss the dependency of the divergence minimum on the input data and encoder parameters, before empirically demonstrating that this dependency does not reduce to either direction of KL divergence for benchmark datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that optimised skew values consistently converge across a range of initial values and provide improved denoising and reconstruction properties. These render $ alpha$-VAEs an efficient and practical modelling choice across a range of tasks, datasets, and domains.

$ alpha$VIL: Learning to Leverage Auxiliary Tasks for Multitask Learning                                                                                  Multitask Learning is a Machine Learning paradigm that aims to train a range of (usually related) tasks with the help of a shared model. While the goal is often to improve the joint performance of all training tasks, another approach is to focus on the performance of a specific target task, while treating the remaining ones as auxiliary data from which to possibly leverage positive transfer towards the target during training. In such settings, it becomes important to estimate the positive or negative influence auxiliary tasks will have on the target. While many ways have been proposed to estimate task weights before or during training they typically rely on heuristics or extensive search of the weighting space. We propose a novel method called $ alpha$-Variable Importance Learning ($ alpha$VIL) that is able to adjust task weights dynamically during model training, by making direct use of task-specific updates of the underlying model's parameters between training epochs. Experiments indicate that $ alpha$VIL is able to outperform other Multitask Learning approaches in a variety of settings. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at making direct use of model updates for task weight estimation.

$ boldsymbolγ$-Net: Superresolving SAR Tomographic Inversion via Deep Learning                                                                                  Synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) has been extensively employed in 3-D reconstruction in dense urban areas using high-resolution SAR acquisitions. Compressive sensing (CS)-based algorithms are generally considered as the state of the art in super-resolving TomoSAR, in particular in the single look case. This superior performance comes at the cost of extra computational burdens, because of the sparse reconstruction, which cannot be solved analytically and we need to employ computationally expensive iterative solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based super-resolving TomoSAR inversion approach, $ boldsymbol{ gamma}$-Net, to tackle this challenge. $ boldsymbol{ gamma}$-Net adopts advanced complex-valued learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (CV-LISTA) to mimic the iterative optimization step in sparse reconstruction. Simulations show the height estimate from a well-trained $ boldsymbol{ gamma}$-Net approaches the Cram 'er-Rao lower bound while improving the computational efficiency by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude comparing to the first-order CS-based methods. It also shows no degradation in the super-resolution power comparing to the state-of-the-art second-order TomoSAR solvers, which are much more computationally expensive than the first-order methods. Specifically, $ boldsymbol{ gamma}$-Net reaches more than $90 %$ detection rate in moderate super-resolving cases at 25 measurements at 6dB SNR. Moreover, simulation at limited baselines demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the second-order CS-based method by a fair margin. Test on real TerraSAR-X data with just 6 interferograms also shows high-quality 3-D reconstruction with high-density detected double scatterers.

In this paper, we propose a new variant of sparse group lasso that blends the $ ell_0$ norm onto the individual weight parameters and the $ ell_{2,1}$ norm onto the output channels of a layer. To address the non-differentiability of the $ ell_0$ norm, we apply variable splitting resulting in an algorithm that consists of executing stochastic gradient descent followed by hard thresholding for each iteration.

$ ell_0$ Sparsifying Transform Learning with Efficient Optimal Updates and Convergence Guarantees                                                                                  Many applications in signal processing benefit from the sparsity of signals in a certain transform domain or dictionary. Synthesis sparsifying dictionaries that are directly adapted to data have been popular in applications such as image denoising, inpainting, and medical image reconstruction. In this work, we focus instead on the sparsifying transform model, and study the learning of well-conditioned square sparsifying transforms. The proposed algorithms alternate between a $ ell_0$ 'norm'-based sparse coding step, and a non-convex transform update step. We derive the exact analytical solution for each of these steps. The proposed solution for the transform update step achieves the global minimum in that step, and also provides speedups over iterative solutions involving conjugate gradients. We establish that our alternating algorithms are globally convergent to the set of local minimizers of the non-convex transform learning problems. In practice, the algorithms are insensitive to initialization. We present results illustrating the promising performance and significant speed-ups of transform learning over synthesis K-SVD in image denoising.

It is well known that most TD learning algorithms are unstable with linear function approximation and off-policy learning. Recent development of Gradient TD (GTD) algorithms has addressed this problem successfully. However, the success of GTD algorithms requires a set of well chosen features, which are not always available. When the number of features is huge, the GTD algorithms might face the problem of overfitting and being computationally expensive. To cope with this difficulty, regularization techniques, in particular $ ell_1$ regularization, have attracted significant attentions in developing TD learning algorithms. The present work combines the GTD algorithms with $ ell_1$ regularization. We propose a family of $ ell_1$ regularized GTD algorithms, which employ the well known soft thresholding operator.

$ ell_1$-K-SVD: A Robust Dictionary Learning Algorithm With Simultaneous Update                                                                                  We develop a dictionary learning algorithm by minimizing the $ ell_1$ distortion metric on the data term, which is known to be robust for non-Gaussian noise contamination. The proposed algorithm exploits the idea of iterative minimization of weighted $ ell_2$ error. We refer to this algorithm as $ ell_1$-K-SVD, where the dictionary atoms and the corresponding sparse coefficients are simultaneously updated to minimize the $ ell_1$ objective, resulting in noise-robustness. We demonstrate through experiments that the $ ell_1$-K-SVD algorithm results in higher atom recovery rate compared with the K-SVD and the robust dictionary learning (RDL) algorithm proposed by Lu et al., both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise conditions. We also show that, for fixed values of sparsity, number of dictionary atoms, and data-dimension, the $ ell_1$-K-SVD algorithm outperforms the K-SVD and RDL algorithms when the training set available is small. We apply the proposed algorithm for denoising natural images corrupted by additive Gaussian and Laplacian noise. The images denoised using $ ell_1$-K-SVD are observed to have slightly higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) over K-SVD for Laplacian noise, but the improvement in structural similarity index (SSIM) is significant (approximately $0.1$) for lower values of input PSNR, indicating the efficacy of the $ ell_1$ metric.

$ ell_1$-regularized Neural Networks are Improperly Learnable in Polynomial Time                                                                                  We study the improper learning of multi-layer neural networks. Suppose that the neural network to be learned has $k$ hidden layers and that the $ ell_1$-norm of the incoming weights of any neuron is bounded by $L$. We present a kernel-based method, such that with probability at least $1 - delta$, it learns a predictor whose generalization error is at most $ epsilon$ worse than that of the neural network. The sample complexity and the time complexity of the presented method are polynomial in the input dimension and in $(1/ epsilon, log(1/ delta),F(k,L))$, where $F(k,L)$ is a function depending on $(k,L)$ and on the activation function, independent of the number of neurons. The algorithm applies to both sigmoid-like activation functions and ReLU-like activation functions. It implies that any sufficiently sparse neural network is learnable in polynomial time.                                                                                  Jason D. Lee

$ ell_p$ Testing and Learning of Discrete Distributions                                                                                  The classic problems of testing uniformity of and learning a discrete distribution, given access to independent samples from it, are examined under general $ ell_p$ metrics. The intuitions and results often contrast with the classic $ ell_1$ case. For $p > 1$, we can learn and test with a number of samples that is independent of the support size of the distribution: With an $ ell_p$ tolerance $ epsilon$, $O( max { sqrt{1/ epsilon^q}, 1/ epsilon^2 })$ samples suffice for testing uniformity and $O( max { 1/ epsilon^q, 1/ epsilon^2 })$ samples suffice for learning, where $q=p/(p-1)$ is the conjugate of $p$. As this parallels the intuition that $O( sqrt{n})$ and $O(n)$ samples suffice for the $ ell_1$ case, it seems that $1/ epsilon^q$ acts as an upper bound on the 'apparent' support size. For some $ ell_p$ metrics, uniformity testing becomes easier over larger supports: a 6-sided die requires fewer trials to test for fairness than a 2-sided coin, and a card-shuffler requires fewer trials than the die. In fact, this inverse dependence on support size holds if and only if $p > frac{4}{3}$. The uniformity testing algorithm simply thresholds the number of 'collisions' or 'coincidences' and has an optimal sample complexity up to constant factors for all $1 leq p leq 2$. Another algorithm gives order-optimal sample complexity for $ ell_{ infty}$ uniformity testing. Meanwhile, the most natural learning algorithm is shown to have order-optimal sample complexity for all $ ell_p$ metrics.

It leverages the large learning capacity of deep networks, as well as the problem-specific expertise that was hardly incorporated in the past design of deep architectures. For the latter, we take into consideration both the prior knowledge of the JPEG compression scheme, and the successful practice of the sparsity-based dual-domain approach. We further design the One-Step Sparse Inference (1-SI) module, as an efficient and light-weighted feed-forward approximation of sparse coding. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the proposed $D^3$ model over several state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our best model is capable of outperforming the latest deep model for around 1 dB in PSNR, and is 30 times faster.

$ mathcal{B}$-Coder: Value-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Program Synthesis                                                                                  Program synthesis aims to create accurate, executable code from natural language descriptions. This field has leveraged the power of reinforcement learning (RL) in conjunction with large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing code generation capabilities. This integration focuses on directly optimizing functional correctness, transcending conventional supervised losses. While current literature predominantly favors policy-based algorithms, attributes of program synthesis suggest a natural compatibility with value-based methods. This stems from rich collection of off-policy programs developed by human programmers, and the straightforward verification of generated programs through automated unit testing (i.e. easily obtainable rewards in RL language). Diverging from the predominant use of policy-based algorithms, our work explores the applicability of value-based approaches, leading to the development of our $ mathcal{B}$-Coder (pronounced Bellman coder). Yet, training value-based methods presents challenges due to the enormous search space inherent to program synthesis. To this end, we propose an initialization protocol for RL agents utilizing pre-trained LMs and a conservative Bellman operator to reduce training complexities. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage the learned value functions as a dual strategy to post-process generated programs. Our empirical evaluations demonstrated $ mathcal{B}$-Coder's capability in achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with policy-based methods. Remarkably, this achievement is reached with minimal reward engineering effort, highlighting the effectiveness of value-based RL, independent of reward designs.

Recent studies have leveraged the power of reinforcement learning (RL) in conjunction with large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing code generation capabilities. The application of RL focuses on directly optimizing for functional correctness, offering an advantage over conventional supervised methods. Despite policy-based RL methods dominating the literature on RL for program synthesis, the nature of program synthesis tasks hints at a natural alignment with value-based methods. This stems from the rich collection of off-policy programs, including those developed by human programmers and also historical samples, coupled with the straightforward verification of generated programs through automated unit testing, meaning rewards are easy to obtain.

$ mathcal{G}$-SGD: Optimizing ReLU Neural Networks in its Positively Scale-Invariant Space                                                                                  It is well known that neural networks with rectified linear units (ReLU) activation functions are positively scale-invariant. Conventional algorithms like stochastic gradient descent optimize the neural networks in the vector space of weights, which is, however, not positively scale-invariant. This mismatch may lead to problems during the optimization process. Then, a natural question is: emph{can we construct a new vector space that is positively scale-invariant and sufficient to represent ReLU neural networks so as to better facilitate the optimization process }? In this paper, we provide our positive answer to this question. First, we conduct a formal study on the positive scaling operators which forms a transformation group, denoted as $ mathcal{G}$. We show that the value of a path (i.e. the product of the weights along the path) in the neural network is invariant to positive scaling and prove that the value vector of all the paths is sufficient to represent the neural networks under mild conditions. Second, we show that one can identify some basis paths out of all the paths and prove that the linear span of their value vectors (denoted as $ mathcal{G}$-space) is an invariant space with lower dimension under the positive scaling group. Finally, we design stochastic gradient descent algorithm in $ mathcal{G}$-space (abbreviated as $ mathcal{G}$-SGD) to optimize the value vector of the basis paths of neural networks with little extra cost by leveraging back-propagation. Our experiments show that $ mathcal{G}$-SGD significantly outperforms the conventional SGD algorithm in optimizing ReLU networks on benchmark datasets.

$ mathcal{L}_1$-$ mathcal{GP}$: $ mathcal{L}_1$ Adaptive Control with Bayesian Learning                                                                                  We present $ mathcal{L}_1$-$ mathcal{GP}$, an architecture based on $ mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for safe simultaneous control and learning. On one hand, the $ mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control provides stability and transient performance guarantees, which allows for GPR to efficiently and safely learn the uncertain dynamics. On the other hand, the learned dynamics can be conveniently incorporated into the $ mathcal{L}_1$ control architecture without sacrificing robustness and tracking performance. Subsequently, the learned dynamics can lead to less conservative designs for performance/robustness tradeoff. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed architecture via numerical simulations.

The method builds on a novel formulation of the $N$-dimensional joint intensity distribution by representing the common anatomy as latent variables and estimating the appearance model with nonparametric estimators. Through connection to maximum likelihood and the expectation-maximization algorithm, an information hyp{}theoretic metric called $ mathcal{X}$-metric and a co-registration algorithm named $ mathcal{X}$-CoReg are induced, allowing groupwise registration of the $N$ observed images with computational complexity of $ mathcal{O}(N)$. Moreover, the method naturally extends for a weakly-supervised scenario where anatomical labels of certain images are provided. This leads to a combined hyp{}computing framework implemented with deep learning, which performs registration and segmentation simultaneously and collaboratively in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the versatility and applicability of our model, including multimodal groupwise registration, motion correction for dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance images, and deep combined computing for multimodal medical images. Results show the superiority of our method in various applications in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the advantage of the proposed representation of the imaging process.

Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the versatility and applicability of our model, including multimodal groupwise registration, motion correction for dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance images, and deep combined computing for multimodal medical images. Results show the superiority of our method in various applications in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the advantage of the proposed representation of the imaging process.

$ mathcal{Y}$-Tuning: An Efficient Tuning Paradigm for Large-Scale Pre-Trained Models via Label Representation Learning                                                                                  With the success of large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs), how efficiently adapting PTMs to downstream tasks has attracted tremendous attention, especially for PTMs with billions of parameters. Although some parameter-efficient tuning paradigms have been proposed to address this problem, they still require large resources to compute and store the gradients in the training phase. In this paper, we propose $ mathcal{Y}$-Tuning, an efficient yet effective paradigm to adapt frozen large-scale PTMs to specific downstream tasks. $ mathcal{Y}$-tuning learns dense representations for labels $ mathcal{Y}$ defined in a given task and aligns them to fixed feature representation. Without tuning the features of input text and model parameters, $ mathcal{Y}$-tuning is both parameter-efficient and training-efficient. Although $ mathcal{Y}$-tuning is currently still not comparable with fine-tuning in performance, it has a great advantage in saving computational cost and has the potential to further improve its performance.

Most existing EMR embedding methods capture visit-code associations by constructing input visit representations as binary vectors with a static vocabulary of medical codes. With this limited representation, they fail in encapsulating rich attribute information of visits (demographics and utilisation information) and/or codes (e.g., medical code descriptions). Furthermore, current work considers visits of the same patient as discrete-time events and ignores time gaps between them. However, the time gaps between visits depict dynamics of the patient's medical history inducing varying influences on future visits. To address these limitations, we present $ mathtt{MedGraph}$, a supervised EMR embedding method that captures two types of information: (1) the visit-code associations in an attributed bipartite graph, and (2) the temporal sequencing of visits through a point process. $ mathtt{MedGraph}$ produces Gaussian embeddings for visits and codes to model the uncertainty. We evaluate the performance of $ mathtt{MedGraph}$ through an extensive experimental study and show that $ mathtt{MedGraph}$ outperforms state-of-the-art EMR embedding methods in several medical risk prediction tasks.

$ nabla τ$: Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning                                                                                  Machine Unlearning, the process of selectively eliminating the influence of certain data examples used during a model's training, has gained significant attention as a means for practitioners to comply with recent data protection regulations. However, existing unlearning methods face critical drawbacks, including their prohibitively high cost, often associated with a large number of hyperparameters, and the limitation of forgetting only relatively small data portions. This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more effective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($ nabla tau$), an optimization framework designed to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently. It applies adaptive gradient ascent to the data to be forgotten while using standard gradient descent for the remaining data. $ nabla tau$ offers multiple benefits over existing approaches. It enables the unlearning of large sections of the training dataset (up to 30%). It is versatile, supporting various unlearning tasks (such as subset forgetting or class removal) and applicable across different domains (images, text, etc.). Importantly, $ nabla tau$ requires no hyperparameter adjustments, making it a more appealing option than retraining the model from scratch. We evaluate our framework's effectiveness using a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics, demonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.

We evaluate our framework's effectiveness using a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics, demonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.

$ partial mathbb{B}$ nets: learning discrete functions by gradient descent                                                                                  $ partial mathbb{B}$ nets are differentiable neural networks that learn discrete boolean-valued functions by gradient descent. $ partial mathbb{B}$ nets have two semantically equivalent aspects: a differentiable soft-net, with real weights, and a non-differentiable hard-net, with boolean weights. We train the soft-net by backpropagation and then `harden' the learned weights to yield boolean weights that bind with the hard-net. The result is a learned discrete function. `Hardening' involves no loss of accuracy, unlike existing approaches to neural network binarization. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that $ partial mathbb{B}$ nets achieve comparable performance on standard machine learning problems yet are compact (due to 1-bit weights) and interpretable (due to the logical nature of the learnt functions).

$ propto$SVM for learning with label proportions                                                                                  We study the problem of learning with label proportions in which the training data is provided in groups and only the proportion of each class in each group is known. We propose a new method called proportion-SVM, or $ propto$SVM, which explicitly models the latent unknown instance labels together with the known group label proportions in a large-margin framework. Unlike the existing works, our approach avoids making restrictive assumptions about the data. The $ propto$SVM model leads to a non-convex integer programming problem. In order to solve it efficiently, we propose two algorithms: one based on simple alternating optimization and the other based on a convex relaxation. Extensive experiments on standard datasets show that $ propto$SVM outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially for larger group sizes.

$ rm A^2Q$: Aggregation-Aware Quantization for Graph Neural Networks                                                                                  As graph data size increases, the vast latency and memory consumption during inference pose a significant challenge to the real-world deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While quantization is a powerful approach to reducing GNNs complexity, most previous works on GNNs quantization fail to exploit the unique characteristics of GNNs, suffering from severe accuracy degradation. Through an in-depth analysis of the topology of GNNs, we observe that the topology of the graph leads to significant differences between nodes, and most of the nodes in a graph appear to have a small aggregation value. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose the Aggregation-Aware mixed-precision Quantization ($ rm A^2Q$) for GNNs, where an appropriate bitwidth is automatically learned and assigned to each node in the graph. To mitigate the vanishing gradient problem caused by sparse connections between nodes, we propose a Local Gradient method to serve the quantization error of the node features as the supervision during training. We also develop a Nearest Neighbor Strategy to deal with the generalization on unseen graphs. Extensive experiments on eight public node-level and graph-level datasets demonstrate the generality and robustness of our proposed method. Compared to the FP32 models, our method can achieve up to a 18.6x (i.e., 1.70bit) compression ratio with negligible accuracy degradation. Morever, compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our method can achieve up to 11.4 % and 9.5 % accuracy improvements on the node-level and graph-level tasks, respectively, and up to 2x speedup on a dedicated hardware accelerator.

Uncertainty-based exploration strategies developed in the bandit setting could theoretically offer a principled way to trade off exploration and exploitation, but applying them to the general reinforcement learning setting is impractical due to their requirement to represent posterior distributions over models, which is computationally intractable in generic sequential decision tasks. Recently, emph{Sample Average Uncertainty (SAU)} was develop as an alternative method to tackle exploration in bandit problems in a scalable way. What makes SAU particularly efficient is that it only depends on the value predictions, meaning that it does not need to rely on maintaining model posterior distributions. In this work we propose emph{$ delta^2$-exploration}, an exploration strategy that extends SAU from bandits to the general sequential Reinforcement Learning scenario. We empirically study $ delta^2$-exploration in the tabular as well as in the Deep Q-learning case, proving its strong practical advantage and wide adaptability to complex reward models such as those deployed in modern Reinforcement Learning.

$ sqrt{n}$-Regret for Learning in Markov Decision Processes with Function Approximation and Low Bellman Rank                                                                                  In this paper, we consider the problem of online learning of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with very large state spaces. Under the assumptions of realizable function approximation and low Bellman ranks, we develop an online learning algorithm that learns the optimal value function while at the same time achieving very low cumulative regret during the learning process. Our learning algorithm, Adaptive Value-function Elimination (AVE), is inspired by the policy elimination algorithm proposed in (Jiang et al., 2017), known as OLIVE. One of our key technical contributions in AVE is to formulate the elimination steps in OLIVE as contextual bandit problems. This technique enables us to apply the active elimination and expert weighting methods from (Dudik et al., 2011), instead of the random action exploration scheme used in the original OLIVE algorithm, for more efficient exploration and better control of the regret incurred in each policy elimination step. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first $ sqrt{n}$-regret result for reinforcement learning in stochastic MDPs with general value function approximation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first $ sqrt{n}$-regret result for reinforcement learning in stochastic MDPs with general value function approximation.

Under the assumptions of realizable function approximation and low Bellman ranks, we develop an online learning algorithm that learns the optimal value function while at the same time achieving very low cumulative regret during the learning process.

Current standard methods primarily rely on synchronous centralized algorithms which induce major communication bottlenecks and limit their usability to High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments with strong connectivity. Decentralized asynchronous algorithms are emerging as a potential alternative but their practical applicability still lags. In this work, we focus on peerto-peer asynchronous methods due to their flexibility and parallelization potentials. In order to mitigate the increase in bandwidth they require at large scale and in poorly connected contexts, we introduce a principled asynchronous, randomized, gossip-based algorithm which works thanks to a continuous momentum named $ textbf{A}^2 textbf{CiD}^2$. In addition to inducing a significant communication acceleration at no cost other than doubling the parameters, minimal adaptation is required to incorporate $ textbf{A}^2 textbf{CiD}^2$ to other asynchronous approaches. We demonstrate its efficiency theoretically and numerically. Empirically on the ring graph, adding $ textbf{A}^2 textbf{CiD}^2$ has the same effect as doubling the communication rate. In particular, we show consistent improvement on the ImageNet dataset using up to 64 asynchronous workers (A100 GPUs) and various communication network topologies.

$ textbf{S}^2$IP-LLM: Semantic Space Informed Prompt Learning with LLM for Time Series Forecasting                                                                                  Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for various time series applications. However, the semantic space of LLMs, established through the pre-training, is still underexplored and may help yield more distinctive and informative representations to facilitate time series forecasting. To this end, we propose Semantic Space Informed Prompt learning with LLM ($S^2$IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series embeddings space and perform time series forecasting based on learned prompts from the joint space. We first design a tokenization module tailored for cross-modality alignment, which explicitly concatenates patches of decomposed time series components to create embeddings that effectively encode the temporal dynamics. Next, we leverage the pre-trained word token embeddings to derive semantic anchors and align selected anchors with time series embeddings by maximizing the cosine similarity in the joint space. This way, $S^2$IP-LLM can retrieve relevant semantic anchors as prompts to provide strong indicators (context) for time series that exhibit different temporal dynamics. With thorough empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed $S^2$IP-LLM can achieve superior forecasting performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies and visualizations verify the necessity of prompt learning informed by semantic space.

$ textit{FastSVD-ML-ROM}$: A Reduced-Order Modeling Framework based on Machine Learning for Real-Time Applications                                                                                  Digital twins have emerged as a key technology for optimizing the performance of engineering products and systems. High-fidelity numerical simulations constitute the backbone of engineering design, providing an accurate insight into the performance of complex systems. However, large-scale, dynamic, non-linear models require significant computational resources and are prohibitive for real-time digital twin applications. To this end, reduced order models (ROMs) are employed, to approximate the high-fidelity solutions while accurately capturing the dominant aspects of the physical behavior. The present work proposes a new machine learning (ML) platform for the development of ROMs, to handle large-scale numerical problems dealing with transient nonlinear partial differential equations. Our framework, mentioned as $ textit{FastSVD-ML-ROM}$, utilizes $ textit{(i)}$ a singular value decomposition (SVD) update methodology, to compute a linear subspace of the multi-fidelity solutions during the simulation process, $ textit{(ii)}$ convolutional autoencoders for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, $ textit{(iii)}$ feed-forward neural networks to map the input parameters to the latent spaces, and $ textit{(iv)}$ long short-term memory networks to predict and forecast the dynamics of parametric solutions. The efficiency of the $ textit{FastSVD-ML-ROM}$ framework is demonstrated for a 2D linear convection-diffusion equation, the problem of fluid around a cylinder, and the 3D blood flow inside an arterial segment. The accuracy of the reconstructed results demonstrates the robustness and assesses the efficiency of the proposed approach.

However the high bandwidth cost of communicating gradient updates between nodes remains a bottleneck; lossy compression is a way to alleviate this problem. We propose a new $ textit{unbiased}$ Vector Quantizer (VQ), named $ texttt{StoVoQ}$, to perform gradient quantization. This approach relies on introducing randomness within the quantization process, that is based on the use of unitarily invariant random codebooks and on a straightforward bias compensation method. The distortion of $ texttt{StoVoQ}$ significantly improves upon existing quantization algorithms. Next, we explain how to combine this quantization scheme within a Federated Learning framework for complex high-dimensional model (dimension $>10^6$), introducing $ texttt{DoStoVoQ}$. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quadratic error and (absence of) bias of the compressor, that allow to leverage strong theoretical results of convergence, e.g., with heterogeneous workers or variance reduction. Finally, we show that training on convex and non-convex deep learning problems, our method leads to significant reduction of bandwidth use while preserving model accuracy.

$ texttt{Mangrove}$: Learning Galaxy Properties from Merger Trees                                                                                  Efficiently mapping baryonic properties onto dark matter is a major challenge in astrophysics. Although semi-analytic models (SAMs) and hydrodynamical simulations have made impressive advances in reproducing galaxy observables across cosmologically significant volumes, these methods still require significant computation times, representing a barrier to many applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently proven to be the natural choice for learning physical relations. Among the most inherently graph-like structures found in astrophysics are the dark matter merger trees that encode the evolution of dark matter halos. In this paper we introduce a new, graph-based emulator framework, $ texttt{Mangrove}$, and show that it emulates the galactic stellar mass, cold gas mass and metallicity, instantaneous and time-averaged star formation rate, and black hole mass -- as predicted by a SAM -- with root mean squared error up to two times lower than other methods across a $(75 Mpc/h)^3$ simulation box in 40 seconds, 4 orders of magnitude faster than the SAM. We show that $ texttt{Mangrove}$ allows for quantification of the dependence of galaxy properties on merger history. We compare our results to the current state of the art in the field and show significant improvements for all target properties. $ texttt{Mangrove}$ is publicly available.

In contrast to the predominant voxel-based approaches, $ texttt{NePhi}$ represents deformations functionally which allows for memory-efficient training and inference. This is of particular importance for large volumetric registrations. Further, while medical image registration approaches representing transformation maps via multi-layer perceptrons have been proposed, $ texttt{NePhi}$ facilitates both pairwise optimization-based registration $ textit{as well as}$ learning-based registration via predicted or optimized global and local latent codes. Lastly, as deformation regularity is a highly desirable property for most medical image registration tasks, $ texttt{NePhi}$ makes use of gradient inverse consistency regularization which empirically results in approximately diffeomorphic transformations. We show the performance of $ texttt{NePhi}$ on two 2D synthetic datasets as well as on real 3D lung registration. Our results show that $ texttt{NePhi}$ can achieve similar accuracies as voxel-based representations in a single-resolution registration setting while using less memory and allowing for faster instance-optimization.

In contrast to the predominant voxel-based transformation fields used in learning-based registration approaches, NePhi represents deformations functionally, leading to great flexibility within the design space of memory consumption during training and inference, inference time, registration accuracy, as well as transformation regularity. Specifically, NePhi 1) requires less memory compared to voxel-based learning approaches, 2) improves inference speed by predicting latent codes, compared to current existing neural deformation based registration approaches that emph{only} rely on optimization, 3) improves accuracy via instance optimization, and 4) shows excellent deformation regularity which is highly desirable for medical image registration. We demonstrate the performance of NePhi on a 2D synthetic dataset as well as for real 3D lung registration. Our results show that NePhi can match the accuracy of voxel-based representations in a single-resolution registration setting. For multi-resolution registration, our method matches the accuracy of current SOTA learning-based registration approaches with instance optimization while reducing memory requirements by a factor of five.

$ texttt{NePhi}$: Neural Deformation Fields for Approximately Diffeomorphic Medical Image Registration                                                                                  This work proposes NePhi, a generalizable neural deformation model which results in approximately diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast to the predominant voxel-based transformation fields used in learning-based registration approaches, NePhi represents deformations functionally, leading to great flexibility within the design space of memory consumption during training and inference, inference time, registration accuracy, as well as transformation regularity. Specifically, NePhi 1) requires less memory compared to voxel-based learning approaches, 2) improves inference speed by predicting latent codes, compared to current existing neural deformation based registration approaches that emph{only} rely on optimization, 3) improves accuracy via instance optimization, and 4) shows excellent deformation regularity which is highly desirable for medical image registration. We demonstrate the performance of NePhi on a 2D synthetic dataset as well as for real 3D lung registration. Our results show that NePhi can match the accuracy of voxel-based representations in a single-resolution registration setting. For multi-resolution registration, our method matches the accuracy of current SOTA learning-based registration approaches with instance optimization while reducing memory requirements by a factor of five.

$ texttt{TACO}$: Temporal Latent Action-Driven Contrastive Loss for Visual Reinforcement Learning                                                                                  Despite recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) from raw pixel data, sample inefficiency continues to present a substantial obstacle. Prior works have attempted to address this challenge by creating self-supervised auxiliary tasks, aiming to enrich the agent's learned representations with control-relevant information for future state prediction. However, these objectives are often insufficient to learn representations that can represent the optimal policy or value function, and they often consider tasks with small, abstract discrete action spaces and thus overlook the importance of action representation learning in continuous control. In this paper, we introduce $ texttt{TACO}$: $ textbf{T}$emporal $ textbf{A}$ction-driven $ textbf{CO}$ntrastive Learning, a simple yet powerful temporal contrastive learning approach that facilitates the concurrent acquisition of latent state and action representations for agents. $ texttt{TACO}$ simultaneously learns a state and an action representation by optimizing the mutual information between representations of current states paired with action sequences and representations of the corresponding future states. Theoretically, $ texttt{TACO}$ can be shown to learn state and action representations that encompass sufficient information for control, thereby improving sample efficiency. For online RL, $ texttt{TACO}$ achieves 40% performance boost after one million environment interaction steps on average across nine challenging visual continuous control tasks from Deepmind Control Suite. In addition, we show that $ texttt{TACO}$ can also serve as a plug-and-play module adding to existing offline visual RL methods to establish the new state-of-the-art performance for offline visual RL across offline datasets with varying quality.Submission Number: 8448

However, fixed aperture remains a key limitation, preventing users from controlling the depth of field (DoF) of captured images. At the same time, many smartphones now have multiple cameras with different fixed apertures - specifically, an ultra-wide camera with wider field of view and deeper DoF and a higher resolution primary camera with shallower DoF. In this work, we propose $ text{DC}^2$, a system for defocus control for synthetically varying camera aperture, focus distance and arbitrary defocus effects by fusing information from such a dual-camera system. Our key insight is to leverage real-world smartphone camera dataset by using image refocus as a proxy task for learning to control defocus. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real-world data demonstrate our system's efficacy where we outperform state-of-the-art on defocus deblurring, bokeh rendering, and image refocus. Finally, we demonstrate creative post-capture defocus control enabled by our method, including tilt-shift and content-based defocus effects.

$ text{H}_{ infty}$ Tracking Control via Variable Gain Gradient Descent-Based Integral Reinforcement Learning for Unknown Continuous Time Nonlinear System                                                                                  Optimal tracking of continuous time nonlinear systems has been extensively studied in literature. However, in several applications, absence of knowledge about system dynamics poses a severe challenge to solving the optimal tracking problem. This has found growing attention among researchers recently, and integral reinforcement learning (IRL)-based method augmented with actor neural network (NN) have been deployed to this end. However, very few studies have been directed to model-free $H_{ infty}$ optimal tracking control that helps in attenuating the effect of disturbances on the system performance without any prior knowledge about system dynamics. To this end a recursive least square-based parameter update was recently proposed. However, gradient descent-based parameter update scheme is more sensitive to real-time variation in plant dynamics. And experience replay (ER) technique has been shown to improve the convergence of NN weights by utilizing past observations iteratively. Motivated by these, this paper presents a novel parameter update law based on variable gain gradient descent and experience replay technique for tuning the weights of critic, actor and disturbance NNs.

$$Research on fusion algorithm of multi-attribute decision making and reinforcement learning based on intuitionistic fuzzy number in wargame environment$$                                                                                  Intelligent games have seen an increasing interest within the research community on artificial intelligence. The article proposes an algorithm that combines the multi-attribute management and reinforcement learning methods, and that joined their effect on wargaming, it solves the problem of the agent’s low rate of winning against specific rules and its inability to quickly converge during intelligent wargame training. At the same time, this paper studied a multi-attribute decision making and reinforcement learning algorithm in a wargame simulation environment, yielding data on the conflict between red and blue sides. We calculate the weight of each attribute based on the intuitionistic fuzzy number weight calculations. And then we determine the threat posed by each opponent’s game agents . Using the red side reinforcement learning reward function, the AC framework is trained on the reward function, and an algorithm combining multi-attribute decision making with reinforcement learning is obtained. A simulation experiment confirms that the algorithm of multi-attribute decision making combined with reinforcement learning presented in this paper is significantly more intelligent than the pure reinforcement learning algorithm. By resolving the shortcomings of the agent’s neural network, coupled with sparse rewards in large-map combat games, this robust algorithm effectively reduces the difficulties of convergence. It is also the first time in this field that an algorithm design for intelligent wargaming combines multi-attribute decision making with reinforcement learning.

$$Research on fusion algorithm of multi-attribute decision making and reinforcement learning based on intuitionistic fuzzy number in wargame environment$$                                                                                  Intelligent games have seen an increasing interest within the research community on artificial intelligence. The article proposes an algorithm that combines the multi-attribute management and reinforcement learning methods, and that joined their effect on wargaming, it solves the problem of the agent’s low rate of winning against specific rules and its inability to quickly converge during intelligent wargame training. At the same time, this paper studied a multi-attribute decision making and reinforcement learning algorithm in a wargame simulation environment, yielding data on the conflict between red and blue sides. We calculate the weight of each attribute based on the intuitionistic fuzzy number weight calculations. And then we determine the threat posed by each opponent’s game agents . Using the red side reinforcement learning reward function, the AC framework is trained on the reward function, and an algorithm combining multi-attribute decision making with reinforcement learning is obtained. A simulation experiment confirms that the algorithm of multi-attribute decision making combined with reinforcement learning presented in this paper is significantly more intelligent than the pure reinforcement learning algorithm. By resolving the shortcomings of the agent’s neural network, coupled with sparse rewards in large-map combat games, this robust algorithm effectively reduces the difficulties of convergence.

$A^{3}D$: A Platform of Searching for Robust Neural Architectures and Efficient Adversarial Attacks                                                                                  The robustness of deep neural networks (DNN) models has attracted increasing attention due to the urgent need for security in many applications. Numerous existing open-sourced tools or platforms are developed to evaluate the robustness of DNN models by ensembling the majority of adversarial attack or defense algorithms. Unfortunately, current platforms do not possess the ability to optimize the architectures of DNN models or the configuration of adversarial attacks to further enhance the robustness of models or the performance of adversarial attacks. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we first propose a novel platform called auto adversarial attack and defense ($A^{3}D$), which can help search for robust neural network architectures and efficient adversarial attacks. In $A^{3}D$, we employ multiple neural architecture search methods, which consider different robustness evaluation metrics, including four types of noises: adversarial noise, natural noise, system noise, and quantified metrics, resulting in finding robust architectures. Besides, we propose a mathematical model for auto adversarial attack, and provide multiple optimization algorithms to search for efficient adversarial attacks. In addition, we combine auto adversarial attack and defense together to form a unified framework. Among auto adversarial defense, the searched efficient attack can be used as the new robustness evaluation to further enhance the robustness. In auto adversarial attack, the searched robust architectures can be utilized as the threat model to help find stronger adversarial attacks. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed platform, which can also provide a benchmark and toolkit for researchers in the application of automated machine learning in evaluating and improving the DNN model robustnesses.

$A^{4}NT$: Author Attribute Anonymity by Adversarial Training of Neural Machine Translation                                                                                  Text-based analysis methods allow to reveal privacy relevant author attributes such as gender, age and identify of the text's author. Such methods can compromise the privacy of an anonymous author even when the author tries to remove privacy sensitive content. In this paper, we propose an automatic method, called Adversarial Author Attribute Anonymity Neural Translation ($A^4NT$), to combat such text-based adversaries. We combine sequence-to-sequence language models used in machine translation and generative adversarial networks to obfuscate author attributes. Unlike machine translation techniques which need paired data, our method can be trained on unpaired corpora of text containing different authors. Importantly, we propose and evaluate techniques to impose constraints on our $A^4NT$ to preserve the semantics of the input text. $A^4NT$ learns to make minimal changes to the input text to successfully fool author attribute classifiers, while aiming to maintain the meaning of the input. We show through experiments on two different datasets and three settings that our proposed method is effective in fooling the author attribute classifiers and thereby improving the anonymity of authors.

$C^*$-Algebraic Machine Learning: Moving in a New Direction                                                                                  Machine learning has a long collaborative tradition with several fields of mathematics, such as statistics, probability and linear algebra. We propose a new direction for machine learning research: $C^*$-algebraic ML $-$ a cross-fertilization between $C^*$-algebra and machine learning. The mathematical concept of $C^*$-algebra is a natural generalization of the space of complex numbers. It enables us to unify existing learning strategies, and construct a new framework for more diverse and information-rich data models. We explain why and how to use $C^*$-algebras in machine learning, and provide technical considerations that go into the design of $C^*$-algebraic learning models in the contexts of kernel methods and neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss open questions and challenges in $C^*$-algebraic ML and give our thoughts for future development and applications.

$C^*$-Algebraic Machine Learning: Moving in a New Direction                                                                                  Machine learning has a long collaborative tradition with several fields of mathematics, such as statistics, probability and linear algebra. We propose a new direction for machine learning research: $C^*$-algebraic ML $-$ a cross-fertilization between $C^*$-algebra and machine learning. The mathematical concept of $C^*$-algebra is a natural generalization of the space of complex numbers. It enables us to unify existing learning strategies, and construct a new framework for more diverse and information-rich data models. We explain why and how to use $C^*$-algebras in machine learning, and provide technical considerations that go into the design of $C^*$-algebraic learning models in the contexts of kernel methods and neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss open questions and challenges in $C^*$-algebraic ML and give our thoughts for future development and applications.

$C^*$-algebra Net: A New Approach Generalizing Neural Network Parameters to $C^*$-algebra                                                                                  We propose a new framework that generalizes the parameters of neural network models to $C^*$-algebra-valued ones. $C^*$-algebra is a generalization of the space of complex numbers. A typical example is the space of continuous functions on a compact space. This generalization enables us to combine multiple models continuously and use tools for functions such as regression and integration. Consequently, we can learn features of data efficiently and adapt the models to problems continuously. We apply our framework to practical problems such as density estimation and few-shot learning and show that our framework enables us to learn features of data even with a limited number of samples. Our new framework highlights the potential possibility of applying the theory of $C^*$-algebra to general neural network models.

$C^3$: Compositional Counterfactual Contrastive Learning for Video-grounded Dialogues                                                                                  Video-grounded dialogue systems aim to integrate video understanding and dialogue understanding to generate responses that are relevant to both the dialogue and video context. Most existing approaches employ deep learning models and have achieved remarkable performance, given the relatively small datasets available. However, the results are partly accomplished by exploiting biases in the datasets rather than developing multimodal reasoning, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of Compositional Counterfactual Contrastive Learning ($C^3$) to develop contrastive training between factual and counterfactual samples in video-grounded dialogues. Specifically, we design factual/counterfactual sampling based on the temporal steps in videos and tokens in dialogues and propose contrastive loss functions that exploit object-level or action-level variance. Different from prior approaches, we focus on contrastive hidden state representations among compositional output tokens to optimize the representation space in a generation setting. We achieved promising performance gains on the Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogues (AVSD) benchmark and showed the benefits of our approach in grounding video and dialogue context.

$C^3DRec$: Cloud-Client Cooperative Deep Learning for Temporal Recommendation in the Post-GDPR Era                                                                                  Mobile devices enable users to retrieve information at any time and any place. Considering the occasional requirements and fragmentation usage pattern of mobile users, temporal recommendation techniques are proposed to improve the efficiency of information retrieval on mobile devices by means of accurately recommending items via learning temporal interests with short-term user interaction behaviors. However, the enforcement of privacy-preserving laws and regulations, such as GDPR, may overshadow the successful practice of temporal recommendation. The reason is that state-of-the-art recommendation systems require to gather and process the user data in centralized servers but the interaction behaviors data used for temporal recommendation are usually non-transactional data that are not allowed to gather without the explicit permission of users according to GDPR. As a result, if users do not permit services to gather their interaction behaviors data, the temporal recommendation fails to work. To realize the temporal recommendation in the post-GDPR era, this paper proposes $C^3DRec$, a cloud-client cooperative deep learning framework of mining interaction behaviors for recommendation while preserving user privacy. $C^3DRec$ constructs a global recommendation model on centralized servers using data collected before GDPR and fine-tunes the model directly on individual local devices using data collected after GDPR. We design two modes to accomplish the recommendation, i.e. pull mode where candidate items are pulled down onto the devices and fed into the local model to get recommended items, and push mode where the output of the local model is pushed onto the server and combined with candidate items to get recommended ones. Evaluation results show that $C^3DRec$ achieves comparable recommendation accuracy to the centralized approaches, with minimal privacy concern.

$DA^3$:Dynamic Additive Attention Adaption for Memory-EfficientOn-Device Multi-Domain Learning                                                                                  Nowadays, one practical limitation of deep neural network (DNN) is its high degree of specialization to a single task or domain (e.g., one visual domain). It motivates researchers to develop algorithms that can adapt DNN model to multiple domains sequentially, while still performing well on the past domains, which is known as multi-domain learning. Almost all conventional methods only focus on improving accuracy with minimal parameter update, while ignoring high computing and memory cost during training, which makes it difficult to deploy multi-domain learning into more and more widely used resource-limited edge devices, like mobile phones, IoT, embedded systems, etc. We observe that large memory used for activation storage is the bottleneck that largely limits the training time and cost on edge devices. To reduce training memory usage, while keeping the domain adaption accuracy performance, we propose Dynamic Additive Attention Adaption ($DA^3$), a novel memory-efficient on-device multi-domain learning method. $DA^3$ learns a novel additive attention adaptor module, while freezing the weights of the pre-trained backbone model for each domain. Differentiating from prior works, such module not only mitigates activation memory buffering for reducing memory usage during training but also serves as a dynamic gating mechanism to reduce the computation cost for fast inference. We validate $DA^3$ on multiple datasets against state-of-the-art methods, which shows great improvement in both accuracy and training time. Moreover, we deployed $DA^3$ into the popular NIVDIA Jetson Nano edge GPU, where the measured experimental results show our proposed $DA^3$ reduces the on-device training memory consumption by 19-37x, and training time by 2x, in comparison to the baseline methods (e.g., standard fine-tuning, Parallel and Series Res. adaptor, and Piggyback).

$DC^2$: A Divide-and-conquer Algorithm for Large-scale Kernel Learning with Application to Clustering                                                                                  Divide-and-conquer is a general strategy to deal with large scale problems. It is typically applied to generate ensemble instances, which potentially limits the problem size it can handle. Additionally, the data are often divided by random sampling which may be suboptimal. To address these concerns, we propose the $DC^2$ algorithm. Instead of ensemble instances, we produce structure-preserving signature pieces to be assembled and conquered. $DC^2$ achieves the efficiency of sampling-based large scale kernel methods while enabling parallel multicore or clustered computation. The data partition and subsequent compression are unified by recursive random projections. Empirically dividing the data by random projections induces smaller mean squared approximation errors than conventional random sampling. The power of $DC^2$ is demonstrated by our clustering algorithm $rpfCluster^+$, which is as accurate as some fastest approximate spectral clustering algorithms while maintaining a running time close to that of K-means clustering. Analysis on $DC^2$ when applied to spectral clustering shows that the loss in clustering accuracy due to data division and reduction is upper bounded by the data approximation error which would vanish with recursive random projections. Due to its easy implementation and flexibility, we expect $DC^2$ to be applicable to general large scale learning problems.

$G$-Mapper: Learning a Cover in the Mapper Construction                                                                                  The Mapper algorithm is a visualization technique in topological data analysis (TDA) that outputs a graph reflecting the structure of a given dataset. The Mapper algorithm requires tuning several parameters in order to generate a 'nice' Mapper graph. The paper focuses on selecting the cover parameter. We present an algorithm that optimizes the cover of a Mapper graph by splitting a cover repeatedly according to a statistical test for normality. Our algorithm is based on $G$-means clustering which searches for the optimal number of clusters in $k$-means by conducting iteratively the Anderson-Darling test. Our splitting procedure employs a Gaussian mixture model in order to choose carefully the cover based on the distribution of a given data. Experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm generates covers so that the Mapper graphs retain the essence of the datasets.

$G^3$: Representation Learning and Generation for Geometric Graphs                                                                                  A geometric graph is a graph equipped with geometric information (i.e., node coordinates). A notable example is molecular graphs, where the combinatorial bonding is supplement with atomic coordinates that determine the three-dimensional structure. This work proposes a generative model for geometric graphs, capitalizing on the complementary information of structure and geometry to learn the underlying distribution. The proposed model, Geometric Graph Generator (G$^3$), orchestrates graph neural networks and point cloud models in a nontrivial manner under an autoencoding framework. Additionally, we augment this framework with a normalizing flow so that one can effectively sample from the otherwise intractable latent space. G$^3$ can be used in computer-aided drug discovery, where seeking novel and optimal molecular structures is critical. As a representation learning approach, the interaction of the graph structure and the geometric point cloud also improve significantly the performance of downstream tasks, such as molecular property prediction. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments to demonstrate that G$^3$ learns more accurately the distribution of given molecules and helps identify novel molecules with better properties of interest.

Our $HS^2$ method can accommodate hypergraph structures and allows one to ask both pointwise queries and pairwise queries. Based on a novel parametric system particularly designed for hypergraphs, we derive theoretical results on the query complexity of $HS^2$ for the above described generalized settings. Both the theoretical and empirical results show that $HS^2$ requires a significantly fewer number of queries than $S^2$ when one uses $S^2$ over a graph obtained from the corresponding hypergraph via clique expansion.

$H_ infty$ Model-free Reinforcement Learning with Robust Stability Guarantee                                                                                  Reinforcement learning is showing great potentials in robotics applications, including autonomous driving, robot manipulation and locomotion. However, with complex uncertainties in the real-world environment, it is difficult to guarantee the successful generalization and sim-to-real transfer of learned policies theoretically. In this paper, we introduce and extend the idea of robust stability and $H_ infty$ control to design policies with both stability and robustness guarantee. Specifically, a sample-based approach for analyzing the Lyapunov stability and performance robustness of a learning-based control system is proposed. Based on the theoretical results, a maximum entropy algorithm is developed for searching Lyapunov function and designing a policy with provable robust stability guarantee. Without any specific domain knowledge, our method can find a policy that is robust to various uncertainties and generalizes well to different test environments. In our experiments, we show that our method achieves better robustness to both large impulsive disturbances and parametric variations in the environment than the state-of-art results in both robust and generic RL, as well as classic control.

$L^*LM$: Learning Automata from Examples using Natural Language Oracles                                                                                  Expert demonstrations have proven an easy way to indirectly specify complex tasks. Recent algorithms even support extracting unambiguous formal specifications, e.g. deterministic finite automata (DFA), from demonstrations. Unfortunately, these techniques are generally not sample efficient. In this work, we introduce $L^*LM$, an algorithm for learning DFAs from both demonstrations and natural language. Due to the expressivity of natural language, we observe a significant improvement in the data efficiency of learning DFAs from expert demonstrations. Technically, $L^*LM$ leverages large language models to answer membership queries about the underlying task. This is then combined with recent techniques for transforming learning from demonstrations into a sequence of labeled example learning problems. In our experiments, we observe the two modalities complement each other, yielding a powerful few-shot learner.

$L^γ$-PageRank for Semi-Supervised Learning                                                                                  PageRank for Semi-Supervised Learning has shown to leverage data structures and limited tagged examples to yield meaningful classification. Despite successes, classification performance can still be improved, particularly in cases of fuzzy graphs or unbalanced labeled data. To address such limitations, a novel approach based on powers of the Laplacian matrix $L^ gamma$ ($ gamma > 0$), referred to as $L^ gamma$-PageRank, is proposed. Its theoretical study shows that it operates on signed graphs, where nodes belonging to one same class are more likely to share positive edges while nodes from different classes are more likely to be connected with negative edges. It is shown that by selecting an optimal $ gamma$, classification performance can be significantly enhanced. A procedure for the automated estimation of the optimal $ gamma$, from a unique observation of data, is devised and assessed. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both $L^ gamma$-PageRank classification and the optimal $ gamma$ estimation.

$L_2$-Uniform Stability of Randomized Learning Algorithms: Sharper Generalization Bounds and Confidence Boosting                                                                                  Exponential generalization bounds with near-optimal rates have recently been established for uniformly stable algorithms~ citep{feldman2019high,bousquet2020sharper}. We seek to extend these best known high probability bounds from deterministic learning algorithms to the regime of randomized learning. One simple approach for achieving this goal is to define the stability for the expectation over the algorithm's randomness, which may result in sharper parameter but only leads to guarantees regarding the on-average generalization error. Another natural option is to consider the stability conditioned on the algorithm's randomness, which is way more stringent but may lead to generalization with high probability jointly over the randomness of sample and algorithm. The present paper addresses such a tension between these two alternatives and makes progress towards relaxing it inside a classic framework of confidence-boosting. To this end, we first introduce a novel concept of $L_2$-uniform stability that holds uniformly over data but in second-moment over the algorithm's randomness. Then as a core contribution of this work, we prove a strong exponential bound on the first-moment of generalization error under the notion of $L_2$-uniform stability. As an interesting consequence of the bound, we show that a bagging-based meta algorithm leads to near-optimal generalization with high probability jointly over the randomness of data and algorithm. We further substantialize these generic results to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to derive sharper exponential bounds for convex or non-convex optimization with natural time-decaying learning rates, which have not been possible to prove with the existing stability-based generalization guarantees.                                                                                  
$N$-gram Is Back: Residual Learning of Neural Text Generation with $n$-gram Language Model                                                                                  $N$-gram language models (LM) have been largely superseded by neural LMs as the latter exhibits better performance. However, we find that $n$-gram models can achieve satisfactory performance on a large proportion of testing cases, indicating they have already captured abundant knowledge of the language with relatively low computational cost. With this observation, we propose to learn a neural LM that fits the residual between an $n$-gram LM and the real-data distribution. The combination of $n$-gram and neural LMs not only allows the neural part to focus on the deeper understanding of language but also provides a flexible way to customize an LM by switching the underlying $n$-gram model without changing the neural model. Experimental results on three typical language tasks (i.e., language modeling, machine translation, and summarization) demonstrate that our approach attains additional performance gains over popular standalone neural models consistently. We also show that our approach allows for effective domain adaptation by simply switching to a domain-specific $n$-gram model, without any extra training.

$O(N^2)$ Universal Antisymmetry in Fermionic Neural Networks                                                                                  Fermionic neural network (FermiNet) is a recently proposed wavefunction Ansatz, which is used in variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods to solve the many-electron Schr '{o}dinger equation. FermiNet proposes permutation-equivariant architectures, on which a Slater determinant is applied to induce antisymmetry. FermiNet is proved to have universal approximation capability with a single determinant, namely, it suffices to represent any antisymmetric function given sufficient parameters. However, the asymptotic computational bottleneck comes from the Slater determinant, which scales with $O(N^3)$ for $N$ electrons. In this paper, we substitute the Slater determinant with a pairwise antisymmetry construction, which is easy to implement and can reduce the computational cost to $O(N^2)$. We formally prove that the pairwise construction built upon permutation-equivariant architectures can universally represent any antisymmetric function. Besides, this universality can be achieved via continuous approximators when we aim to represent ground-state wavefunctions.

$P^{3}O$: Transferring Visual Representations for Reinforcement Learning via Prompting                                                                                  It is important for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to transfer their learned policies to new environments that have different visual inputs. In this paper, we introduce Prompt based Proximal Policy Optimization ($P^{3}O$), a three-stage DRL algorithm that transfers visual representations from a target to a source environment by applying prompting. The process of $P^{3}O$ consists of three stages: pre-training, prompting, and predicting. In particular, we specify a prompt-transformer for representation conversion and propose a two-step training process to train the prompt-transformer for the target environment, while the rest of the DRL pipeline remains unchanged. We implement $P^{3}O$ and evaluate it on the OpenAI CarRacing video game. The experimental results show that $P^{3}O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art visual transferring schemes. In particular, $P^{3}O$ allows the learned policies to perform well in environments with different visual inputs, which is much more effective than retraining the policies in these environments.

$Q$- and $A$-Learning Methods for Estimating Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes                                                                                  In clinical practice, physicians make a series of treatment decisions over the course of a patient's disease based on his/her baseline and evolving characteristics. A dynamic treatment regime is a set of sequential decision rules that operationalizes this process. Each rule corresponds to a decision point and dictates the next treatment action based on the accrued information. Using existing data, a key goal is estimating the optimal regime, that, if followed by the patient population, would yield the most favorable outcome on average. Q- and A-learning are two main approaches for this purpose. We provide a detailed account of these methods, study their performance, and illustrate them using data from a depression study.

$Q$-learning with Logarithmic Regret                                                                                  This paper presents the first non-asymptotic result showing that a model-free algorithm can achieve a logarithmic cumulative regret for episodic tabular reinforcement learning if there exists a strictly positive sub-optimality gap in the optimal $Q$-function. We prove that the optimistic $Q$-learning studied in [Jin et al. 2018] enjoys a ${ mathcal{O}} left( frac{SA cdot mathrm{poly} left(H right)}{ Delta_{ min}} log left(SAT right) right)$ cumulative regret bound, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the planning horizon, $T$ is the total number of steps, and $ Delta_{ min}$ is the minimum sub-optimality gap. This bound matches the information theoretical lower bound in terms of $S,A,T$ up to a $ log left(SA right)$ factor. We further extend our analysis to the discounted setting and obtain a similar logarithmic cumulative regret bound.

$R^2$-Tuning: Efficient Image-to-Video Transfer Learning for Video Temporal Grounding                                                                                  Video temporal grounding (VTG) is a fine-grained video understanding problem that aims to ground relevant clips in untrimmed videos given natural language queries. Most existing VTG models are built upon frame-wise final-layer CLIP features, aided by additional temporal backbones (e.g., SlowFast) with sophisticated temporal reasoning mechanisms. In this work, we claim that CLIP itself already shows great potential for fine-grained spatial-temporal modeling, as each layer offers distinct yet useful information under different granularity levels. Motivated by this, we propose Reversed Recurrent Tuning ($R^2$-Tuning), a parameter- and memory-efficient transfer learning framework for video temporal grounding. Our method learns a lightweight $R^2$ Block containing only 1.5% of the total parameters to perform progressive spatial-temporal modeling. Starting from the last layer of CLIP, $R^2$ Block recurrently aggregates spatial features from earlier layers, then refines temporal correlation conditioning on the given query, resulting in a coarse-to-fine scheme. $R^2$-Tuning achieves state-of-the-art performance across three VTG tasks (i.e., moment retrieval, highlight detection, and video summarization) on six public benchmarks (i.e., QVHighlights, Charades-STA, Ego4D-NLQ, TACoS, YouTube Highlights, and TVSum) even without the additional backbone, demonstrating the significance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Starting from the last layer of CLIP, $R^2$ Block recurrently aggregates spatial features from earlier layers, then refines temporal correlation conditioning on the given query, resulting in a coarse-to-fine scheme. $R^2$-Tuning achieves state-of-the-art performance across three VTG tasks (i.e., moment retrieval, highlight detection, and video summarization) on six public benchmarks (i.e., QVHighlights, Charades-STA, Ego4D-NLQ, TACoS, YouTube Highlights, and TVSum) even without the additional backbone, demonstrating the significance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Our code is available at https://github.com/yeliudev/R2-Tuning.                                                                                  Junsik Kim
$S^{2}$-LBI: Stochastic Split Linearized Bregman Iterations for Parsimonious Deep Learning                                                                                  This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Split Linearized Bregman Iteration ($S^{2}$-LBI) algorithm to efficiently train the deep network. The $S^{2}$-LBI introduces an iterative regularization path with structural sparsity. Our $S^{2}$-LBI combines the computational efficiency of the LBI, and model selection consistency in learning the structural sparsity. The computed solution path intrinsically enables us to enlarge or simplify a network, which theoretically, is benefited from the dynamics property of our $S^{2}$-LBI algorithm. The experimental results validate our $S^{2}$-LBI on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset. For example, in MNIST, we can either boost a network with only 1.5K parameters (1 convolutional layer of 5 filters, and 1 FC layer), achieves 98.40 % recognition accuracy; or we simplify $82.5 %$ of parameters in LeNet-5 network, and still achieves the 98.47 % recognition accuracy. In addition, we also have the learning results on ImageNet, which will be added in the next version of our report.

$Se^2$: Sequential Example Selection for In-Context Learning                                                                                  The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) for in-context learning (ICL) needs to be activated by demonstration examples. Prior work has extensively explored the selection of examples for ICL, predominantly following the 'select then organize' paradigm, such approaches often neglect the internal relationships between examples and exist an inconsistency between the training and inference. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a $ textit{se}$quential $ textit{se}$lection problem and introduce $Se^2$, a sequential-aware method that leverages the LLM's feedback on varying context, aiding in capturing inter-relationships and sequential information among examples, significantly enriching the contextuality and relevance of ICL prompts. Meanwhile, we utilize beam search to seek and construct example sequences, enhancing both quality and diversity. Extensive experiments across 23 NLP tasks from 8 distinct categories illustrate that $Se^2$ markedly surpasses competitive baselines and achieves 42% relative improvement over random selection. Further in-depth analysis show the effectiveness of proposed strategies, highlighting $Se^2$'s exceptional stability and adaptability across various scenarios. Our code will be released to facilitate future research.                                                                                  Jianfeng Liu

$f$-Cal: Calibrated aleatoric uncertainty estimation from neural networks for robot perception                                                                                  While modern deep neural networks are performant perception modules, performance (accuracy) alone is insufficient, particularly for safety-critical robotic applications such as self-driving vehicles. Robot autonomy stacks also require these otherwise blackbox models to produce reliable and calibrated measures of confidence on their predictions. Existing approaches estimate uncertainty from these neural network perception stacks by modifying network architectures, inference procedure, or loss functions. However, in general, these methods lack calibration, meaning that the predictive uncertainties do not faithfully represent the true underlying uncertainties (process noise). Our key insight is that calibration is only achieved by imposing constraints across multiple examples, such as those in a mini-batch; as opposed to existing approaches which only impose constraints per-sample, often leading to overconfident (thus miscalibrated) uncertainty estimates. By enforcing the distribution of outputs of a neural network to resemble a target distribution by minimizing an $f$-divergence, we obtain significantly better-calibrated models compared to prior approaches. Our approach, $f$-Cal, outperforms existing uncertainty calibration approaches on robot perception tasks such as object detection and monocular depth estimation over multiple real-world benchmarks.

$f$-Cal: Calibrated aleatoric uncertainty estimation from neural networks for robot perception                                                                                  While modern deep neural networks are performant perception modules, performance (accuracy) alone is insufficient, particularly for safety-critical robotic applications such as self-driving vehicles. Robot autonomy stacks also require these otherwise blackbox models to produce reliable and calibrated measures of confidence on their predictions. Existing approaches estimate uncertainty from these neural network perception stacks by modifying network architectures, inference procedure, or loss functions. However, in general, these methods lack calibration, meaning that the predictive uncertainties do not faithfully represent the true underlying uncertainties (process noise). Our key insight is that calibration is only achieved by imposing constraints across multiple examples, such as those in a mini-batch; as opposed to existing approaches which only impose constraints per-sample, often leading to overconfident (thus miscalibrated) uncertainty estimates. By enforcing the distribution of outputs of a neural network to resemble a target distribution by minimizing an $f$-divergence, we obtain significantly better-calibrated models compared to prior approaches.

$f$-GAIL: Learning $f$-Divergence for Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning                                                                                  Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations that minimizes the discrepancy between the learner and expert behaviors. Various imitation learning algorithms have been proposed with different pre-determined divergences to quantify the discrepancy. This naturally gives rise to the following question: Given a set of expert demonstrations, which divergence can recover the expert policy more accurately with higher data efficiency? In this work, we propose $f$-GAIL, a new generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model, that automatically learns a discrepancy measure from the $f$-divergence family as well as a policy capable of producing expert-like behaviors. Compared with IL baselines with various predefined divergence measures, $f$-GAIL learns better policies with higher data efficiency in six physics-based control tasks.

$f$-MICL: Understanding and Generalizing InfoNCE-based Contrastive Learning                                                                                  In self-supervised contrastive learning, a widely-adopted objective function is InfoNCE, which uses the heuristic cosine similarity for the representation comparison, and is closely related to maximizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based mutual information. In this paper, we aim at answering two intriguing questions: (1) Can we go beyond the KL-based objective? (2) Besides the popular cosine similarity, can we design a better similarity function? We provide answers to both questions by generalizing the KL-based mutual information to the $f$-Mutual Information in Contrastive Learning ($f$-MICL) using the $f$-divergences. To answer the first question, we provide a wide range of $f$-MICL objectives which share the nice properties of InfoNCE (e.g., alignment and uniformity), and meanwhile result in similar or even superior performance. For the second question, assuming that the joint feature distribution is proportional to the Gaussian kernel, we derive an $f$-Gaussian similarity with better interpretability and empirical performance. Finally, we identify close relationships between the $f$-MICL objective and several popular InfoNCE-based objectives. Using benchmark tasks from both vision and natural language, we empirically evaluate $f$-MICL with different $f$-divergences on various architectures (SimCLR, MoCo, and MoCo v3) and datasets. We observe that $f$-MICL generally outperforms the benchmarks and the best-performing $f$-divergence is task and dataset dependent.

$k$-$t$ CLAIR: Self-Consistency Guided Multi-Prior Learning for Dynamic Parallel MR Image Reconstruction                                                                                  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has been widely used in clinical practice for the medical diagnosis of cardiac diseases. However, the long acquisition time hinders its development in real-time applications. Here, we propose a novel self-consistency guided multi-prior learning framework named $k$-$t$ CLAIR to exploit spatiotemporal correlations from highly undersampled data for accelerated dynamic parallel MRI reconstruction. The $k$-$t$ CLAIR progressively reconstructs faithful images by leveraging multiple complementary priors learned in the $x$-$t$, $x$-$f$, and $k$-$t$ domains in an iterative fashion, as dynamic MRI exhibits high spatiotemporal redundancy. Additionally, $k$-$t$ CLAIR incorporates calibration information for prior learning, resulting in a more consistent reconstruction. Experimental results on cardiac cine and T1W/T2W images demonstrate that $k$-$t$ CLAIR achieves high-quality dynamic MR reconstruction in terms of both quantitative and qualitative performance.

$k$-Anonymity in Practice: How Generalisation and Suppression Affect Machine Learning Classifiers                                                                                  The protection of private information is a crucial issue in data-driven research and business contexts. Typically, techniques like anonymisation or (selective) deletion are introduced in order to allow data sharing, e. g. in the case of collaborative research endeavours. For use with anonymisation techniques, the $k$-anonymity criterion is one of the most popular, with numerous scientific publications on different algorithms and metrics. Anonymisation techniques often require changing the data and thus necessarily affect the results of machine learning models trained on the underlying data. In this work, we conduct a systematic comparison and detailed investigation into the effects of different $k$-anonymisation algorithms on the results of machine learning models. We investigate a set of popular $k$-anonymisation algorithms with different classifiers and evaluate them on different real-world datasets. Our systematic evaluation shows that with an increasingly strong $k$-anonymity constraint, the classification performance generally degrades, but to varying degrees and strongly depending on the dataset and anonymisation method. Furthermore, Mondrian can be considered as the method with the most appealing properties for subsequent classification.

For use with anonymisation techniques, the $k$-anonymity criterion is one of the most popular, with numerous scientific publications on different algorithms and metrics. Anonymisation techniques often require changing the data and thus necessarily affect the results of machine learning models trained on the underlying data. In this work, we conduct a systematic comparison and detailed investigation into the effects of different $k$-anonymisation algorithms on the results of machine learning models. We investigate a set of popular $k$-anonymisation algorithms with different classifiers and evaluate them on different real-world datasets. Our systematic evaluation shows that with an increasingly strong $k$-anonymity constraint, the classification performance generally degrades, but to varying degrees and strongly depending on the dataset and anonymisation method. Furthermore, Mondrian can be considered as the method with the most appealing properties for subsequent classification.

$k$-Mixup Regularization for Deep Learning via Optimal Transport                                                                                  Mixup is a popular regularization technique for training deep neural networks that can improve generalization and increase adversarial robustness. It perturbs input training data in the direction of other randomly-chosen instances in the training set. To better leverage the structure of the data, we extend mixup to $k$-mixup by perturbing $k$-batches of training points in the direction of other $k$-batches using displacement interpolation, i.e. interpolation under the Wasserstein metric. We demonstrate theoretically and in simulations that $k$-mixup preserves cluster and manifold structures, and we extend theory studying the efficacy of standard mixup to the $k$-mixup case. Our empirical results show that training with $k$-mixup further improves generalization and robustness across several network architectures and benchmark datasets of differing modalities.

$k$-Nearest Neighbor Augmented Neural Networks for Text Classification                                                                                  In recent years, many deep-learning based models are proposed for text classification. This kind of models well fits the training set from the statistical point of view. However, it lacks the capacity of utilizing instance-level information from individual instances in the training set. In this work, we propose to enhance neural network models by allowing them to leverage information from $k$-nearest neighbor (kNN) of the input text. Our model employs a neural network that encodes texts into text embeddings. Moreover, we also utilize $k$-nearest neighbor of the input text as an external memory, and utilize it to capture instance-level information from the training set. The final prediction is made based on features from both the neural network encoder and the kNN memory. Experimental results on several standard benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the baseline model on all the datasets, and it even beats a very deep neural network model (with 29 layers) in several datasets. Our model also shows superior performance when training instances are scarce, and when the training set is severely unbalanced. Our model also leverages techniques such as semi-supervised training and transfer learning quite well.                                                                                  Linfeng Song

$k$NN Prompting: Beyond-Context Learning with Calibration-Free Nearest Neighbor Inference                                                                                  In-Context Learning (ICL), which formulates target tasks as prompt completion conditioned on in-context demonstrations, has become the prevailing utilization of LLMs. In this paper, we first disclose an actual predicament for this typical usage that it can not scale up with training data due to context length restriction. Besides, existing works have shown that ICL also suffers from various biases and requires delicate calibration treatment. To address both challenges, we advocate a simple and effective solution, $k$NN Prompting, which first queries LLM with training data for distributed representations, then predicts test instances by simply referring to nearest neighbors. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate its two-fold superiority: 1) Calibration-Free: $k$NN Prompting does not directly align LLM output distribution with task-specific label space, instead leverages such distribution to align test and training instances. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art calibration-based methods under comparable few-shot scenario. 2) Beyond-Context: $k$NN Prompting can further scale up effectively with as many training data as are available, continually bringing substantial improvements. The scaling trend holds across 10 orders of magnitude ranging from 2 shots to 1024 shots as well as different LLMs scales ranging from 0.8B to 30B. It successfully bridges data scaling into model scaling, and brings new potentials for the gradient-free paradigm of LLM deployment.

$m$-mix: Generating hard negatives via multiple samples mixing for contrastive learning                                                                                  Negative pairs are essential in contrastive learning, which plays the role of avoiding degenerate solutions. Hard negatives can improve the representation ability on the basis of common negatives. Inspired by recent hard negative mining methods via mixup operation in vision, we propose $m$-mix, which generates hard negatives dynamically. Compared with previous methods, $m$-mix mainly has three advantages: 1) adaptively chooses samples to mix; 2) simultaneously mixes multiple samples; 3) automatically and comprehensively assigns different mixing weights to the selected mixing samples. We evaluate our method on two image classification datasets, five node classification datasets (PPI, DBLP, Pubmed, etc), five graph classification datasets (IMDB, PTC _MR, etc), and downstream combinatorial tasks (graph edit distance and clustering). Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks under self-supervised settings.

$m^ ast$ of two-dimensional electron gas: a neural canonical transformation study                                                                                  The quasiparticle effective mass $m^ ast$ of interacting electrons is a fundamental quantity in the Fermi liquid theory. However, the precise value of the effective mass of uniform electron gas is still elusive after decades of research. The newly developed neural canonical transformation approach [Xie et al., J. Mach. Learn. 1, (2022)] offers a principled way to extract the effective mass of electron gas by directly calculating the thermal entropy at low temperature. The approach models a variational many-electron density matrix using two generative neural networks: an autoregressive model for momentum occupation and a normalizing flow for electron coordinates. Our calculation reveals a suppression of effective mass in the two-dimensional spin-polarized electron gas, which is more pronounced than previous reports in the low-density strong-coupling region. This prediction calls for verification in two-dimensional electron gas experiments.                                                                                  Hao Xie

$n$-Reference Transfer Learning for Saliency Prediction                                                                                  Benefiting from deep learning research and large-scale datasets, saliency prediction has achieved significant success in the past decade. However, it still remains challenging to predict saliency maps on images in new domains that lack sufficient data for data-hungry models. To solve this problem, we propose a few-shot transfer learning paradigm for saliency prediction, which enables efficient transfer of knowledge learned from the existing large-scale saliency datasets to a target domain with limited labeled examples. Specifically, very few target domain examples are used as the reference to train a model with a source domain dataset such that the training process can converge to a local minimum in favor of the target domain. Then, the learned model is further fine-tuned with the reference. The proposed framework is gradient-based and model-agnostic. We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation study on various source domain and target domain pairs. The results show that the proposed framework achieves a significant performance improvement. The code is publicly available at url{https://github.com/luoyan407/n-reference}.                                                                                  Yan Luo

$p$-DkNN: Out-of-Distribution Detection Through Statistical Testing of Deep Representations                                                                                  The lack of well-calibrated confidence estimates makes neural networks inadequate in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving or healthcare. In these settings, having the ability to abstain from making a prediction on out-of-distribution (OOD) data can be as important as correctly classifying in-distribution data. We introduce $p$-DkNN, a novel inference procedure that takes a trained deep neural network and analyzes the similarity structures of its intermediate hidden representations to compute $p$-values associated with the end-to-end model prediction. The intuition is that statistical tests performed on latent representations can serve not only as a classifier, but also offer a statistically well-founded estimation of uncertainty. $p$-DkNN is scalable and leverages the composition of representations learned by hidden layers, which makes deep representation learning successful. Our theoretical analysis builds on Neyman-Pearson classification and connects it to recent advances in selective classification (reject option). We demonstrate advantageous trade-offs between abstaining from predicting on OOD inputs and maintaining high accuracy on in-distribution inputs. We find that $p$-DkNN forces adaptive attackers crafting adversarial examples, a form of worst-case OOD inputs, to introduce semantically meaningful changes to the inputs.

$p$-Laplacian Based Graph Neural Networks                                                                                  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance for semi-supervised node classification on graphs, as a result of their ability to exploit node features and topological information simultaneously. However, most GNNs implicitly assume that the labels of nodes and their neighbors in a graph are the same or consistent, which does not hold in heterophilic graphs, where the labels of linked nodes are likely to differ. Hence, when the topology is non-informative for label prediction, ordinary GNNs may work significantly worse than simply applying multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) on each node. To tackle the above problem, we propose a new $p$-Laplacian based GNN model, termed as $^p$GNN, whose message passing mechanism is derived from a discrete regularization framework and could be theoretically explained as an approximation of a polynomial graph filter defined on the spectral domain of $p$-Laplacians. The spectral analysis shows that the new message passing mechanism works simultaneously as low-pass and high-pass filters, thus making $^p$GNNs are effective on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Empirical studies on real-world and synthetic datasets validate our findings and demonstrate that $^p$GNNs significantly outperform several state-of-the-art GNN architectures on heterophilic benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on homophilic benchmarks. Moreover, $^p$GNNs can adaptively learn aggregation weights and are robust to noisy edges.                                                                                  Yatao Bian

Though significant improvement has been shown with the Boltzmann softmax policy, when the Tsallis sparsemax policy is considered, the augmentation leads to a flat learning curve for almost every problem considered. We show that it is due to the mismatch between the conventional logarithm and the non-logarithmic (generalized) nature of Tsallis entropy. Drawing inspiration from the Tsallis statistics literature, we propose to correct the mismatch of M-RL with the help of $q$-logarithm/exponential functions. The proposed formulation leads to implicit Tsallis KL regularization under the maximum Tsallis entropy framework. We show such formulation of M-RL again achieves superior performance on benchmark problems and sheds light on more general M-RL with various entropic indices $q$.

$r-$Adaptive Deep Learning Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations                                                                                  We introduce an $r-$adaptive algorithm to solve Partial Differential Equations using a Deep Neural Network. The proposed method restricts to tensor product meshes and optimizes the boundary node locations in one dimension, from which we build two- or three-dimensional meshes. The method allows the definition of fixed interfaces to design conforming meshes, and enables changes in the topology, i.e., some nodes can jump across fixed interfaces. The method simultaneously optimizes the node locations and the PDE solution values over the resulting mesh. To numerically illustrate the performance of our proposed $r-$adaptive method, we apply it in combination with a collocation method, a Least Squares Method, and a Deep Ritz Method. We focus on the latter to solve one- and two-dimensional problems whose solutions are smooth, singular, and/or exhibit strong gradients.

$t^3$-Variational Autoencoder: Learning Heavy-tailed Data with Student's t and Power Divergence                                                                                  The variational autoencoder (VAE) typically employs a standard normal prior as a regularizer for the probabilistic latent encoder. However, the Gaussian tail often decays too quickly to effectively accommodate the encoded points, failing to preserve crucial structures hidden in the data. In this paper, we explore the use of heavy-tailed models to combat over-regularization. Drawing upon insights from information geometry, we propose $t^3$VAE, a modified VAE framework that incorporates Student's t-distributions for the prior, encoder, and decoder. This results in a joint model distribution of a power form which we argue can better fit real-world datasets. We derive a new objective by reformulating the evidence lower bound as joint optimization of KL divergence between two statistical manifolds and replacing with $ gamma$-power divergence, a natural alternative for power families. $t^3$VAE demonstrates superior generation of low-density regions when trained on heavy-tailed synthetic data. Furthermore, we show that $t^3$VAE significantly outperforms other models on CelebA and imbalanced CIFAR-100 datasets.

$z$-SignFedAvg: A Unified Stochastic Sign-based Compression for Federated Learning                                                                                  Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm but suffers from high communication cost when training large-scale machine learning models. Sign-based methods, such as SignSGD cite{bernstein2018signsgd}, have been proposed as a biased gradient compression technique for reducing the communication cost. However, sign-based algorithms could diverge under heterogeneous data, which thus motivated the development of advanced techniques, such as the error-feedback method and stochastic sign-based compression, to fix this issue. Nevertheless, these methods still suffer from slower convergence rates. Besides, none of them allows multiple local SGD updates like FedAvg cite{mcmahan2017communication}. In this paper, we propose a novel noisy perturbation scheme with a general symmetric noise distribution for sign-based compression, which not only allows one to flexibly control the tradeoff between gradient bias and convergence performance, but also provides a unified viewpoint to existing stochastic sign-based methods. More importantly, the unified noisy perturbation scheme enables the development of the very first sign-based FedAvg algorithm ($z$-SignFedAvg) to accelerate the convergence. Theoretically, we show that $z$-SignFedAvg achieves a faster convergence rate than existing sign-based methods and, under the uniformly distributed noise, can enjoy the same convergence rate as its uncompressed counterpart. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the $z$-SignFedAvg can achieve competitive empirical performance on real datasets and outperforms existing schemes.

${ rm E}(3)$-Equivariant Actor-Critic Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning                                                                                  Identification and analysis of symmetrical patterns in the natural world have led to significant discoveries across various scientific fields, such as the formulation of gravitational laws in physics and advancements in the study of chemical structures. In this paper, we focus on exploiting Euclidean symmetries inherent in certain cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems and prevalent in many applications. We begin by formally characterizing a subclass of Markov games with a general notion of symmetries that admits the existence of symmetric optimal values and policies. Motivated by these properties, we design neural network architectures with symmetric constraints embedded as an inductive bias for multi-agent actor-critic methods. This inductive bias results in superior performance in various cooperative MARL benchmarks and impressive generalization capabilities such as zero-shot learning and transfer learning in unseen scenarios with repeated symmetric patterns.

$Δ$-PINNs: physics-informed neural networks on complex geometries                                                                                  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated promise in solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. Despite recent progress on expanding the class of problems that can be tackled by PINNs, most of existing use-cases involve simple geometric domains. To date, there is no clear way to inform PINNs about the topology of the domain where the problem is being solved. In this work, we propose a novel positional encoding mechanism for PINNs based on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. This technique allows to create an input space for the neural network that represents the geometry of a given object. We approximate the eigenfunctions as well as the operators involved in the partial differential equations with finite elements. We extensively test and compare the proposed methodology against traditional PINNs in complex shapes, such as a coil, a heat sink and a bunny, with different physics, such as the Eikonal equation and heat transfer. We also study the sensitivity of our method to the number of eigenfunctions used, as well as the discretization used for the eigenfunctions and the underlying operators. Our results show excellent agreement with the ground truth data in cases where traditional PINNs fail to produce a meaningful solution. We envision this new technique will expand the effectiveness of PINNs to more realistic applications.

$Π-$nets: Deep Polynomial Neural Networks                                                                                  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) is currently the method of choice both for generative, as well as for discriminative learning in computer vision and machine learning. The success of DCNNs can be attributed to the careful selection of their building blocks (e.g., residual blocks, rectifiers, sophisticated normalization schemes, to mention but a few). In this paper, we propose $ Pi$-Nets, a new class of DCNNs. $ Pi$-Nets are polynomial neural networks, i.e., the output is a high-order polynomial of the input. $ Pi$-Nets can be implemented using special kind of skip connections and their parameters can be represented via high-order tensors. We empirically demonstrate that $ Pi$-Nets have better representation power than standard DCNNs and they even produce good results without the use of non-linear activation functions in a large battery of tasks and signals, i.e., images, graphs, and audio. When used in conjunction with activation functions, $ Pi$-Nets produce state-of-the-art results in challenging tasks, such as image generation. Lastly, our framework elucidates why recent generative models, such as StyleGAN, improve upon their predecessors, e.g., ProGAN.

The networks in $ Sigma$-net are trained in a supervised way, including content and GAN losses, and with various ways of data consistency, i.e., proximal mappings, gradient descent and variable splitting. A semi-supervised finetuning scheme allows us to adapt to the k-space data at test time, which, however, decreases the quantitative metrics, although generating the visually most textured and sharp images. For this challenge, we focused on robust and high SSIM scores, which we achieved by ensembling all models to a $ Sigma$-net.

$Σ$-net: Systematic Evaluation of Iterative Deep Neural Networks for Fast Parallel MR Image Reconstruction                                                                                  Purpose: To systematically investigate the influence of various data consistency layers, (semi-)supervised learning and ensembling strategies, defined in a $ Sigma$-net, for accelerated parallel MR image reconstruction using deep learning. Theory and Methods: MR image reconstruction is formulated as learned unrolled optimization scheme with a Down-Up network as regularization and varying data consistency layers. The different architectures are split into sensitivity networks, which rely on explicit coil sensitivity maps, and parallel coil networks, which learn the combination of coils implicitly. Different content and adversarial losses, a semi-supervised fine-tuning scheme and model ensembling are investigated. Results: Evaluated on the fastMRI multicoil validation set, architectures involving raw k-space data outperform image enhancement methods significantly. Semi-supervised fine-tuning adapts to new k-space data and provides, together with reconstructions based on adversarial training, the visually most appealing results although quantitative quality metrics are reduced. The $ Sigma$-net ensembles the benefits from different models and achieves similar scores compared to the single state-of-the-art approaches.

$α$-Divergence Loss Function for Neural Density Ratio Estimation                                                                                  Recently, neural networks have produced state-of-the-art results for density-ratio estimation (DRE), a fundamental technique in machine learning. However, existing methods bear optimization issues that arise from the loss functions of DRE: a large sample requirement of Kullback--Leibler (KL)-divergence, vanishing of train loss gradients, and biased gradients of the loss functions. Thus, an $ alpha$-divergence loss function ($ alpha$-Div) that offers concise implementation and stable optimization is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, technical justifications for the proposed loss function are presented. The stability of the proposed loss function is empirically demonstrated and the estimation accuracy of DRE tasks is investigated. Additionally, this study presents a sample requirement for DRE using the proposed loss function in terms of the upper bound of $L_1$ error, which connects a curse of dimensionality as a common problem in high-dimensional DRE tasks.

$α$-Stable convergence of heavy-tailed infinitely-wide neural networks                                                                                  We consider infinitely-wide multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) which are limits of standard deep feed-forward neural networks. We assume that, for each layer, the weights of an MLP are initialized with i.i.d. samples from either a light-tailed (finite variance) or heavy-tailed distribution in the domain of attraction of a symmetric $ alpha$-stable distribution, where $ alpha in(0,2]$ may depend on the layer. For the bias terms of the layer, we assume i.i.d. initializations with a symmetric $ alpha$-stable distribution having the same $ alpha$ parameter of that layer. We then extend a recent result of Favaro, Fortini, and Peluchetti (2020), to show that the vector of pre-activation values at all nodes of a given hidden layer converges in the limit, under a suitable scaling, to a vector of i.i.d. random variables with symmetric $ alpha$-stable distributions.

$α$-divergence Improves the Entropy Production Estimation via Machine Learning                                                                                  Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the algorithmic estimation of stochastic entropy production (EP) from trajectory data via machine learning. A crucial element of such algorithms is the identification of a loss function whose minimization guarantees the accurate EP estimation. In this study, we show that there exists a host of loss functions, namely those implementing a variational representation of the $ alpha$-divergence, which can be used for the EP estimation. By fixing $ alpha$ to a value between $-1$ and $0$, the $ alpha$-NEEP (Neural Estimator for Entropy Production) exhibits a much more robust performance against strong nonequilibrium driving or slow dynamics, which adversely affects the existing method based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($ alpha = 0$). In particular, the choice of $ alpha = -0.5$ tends to yield the optimal results. To corroborate our findings, we present an exactly solvable simplification of the EP estimation problem, whose loss function landscape and stochastic properties give deeper intuition into the robustness of the $ alpha$-NEEP.

In our $ beta$-CapsNet framework, hyperparameter $ beta$ is utilized to trade-off disentanglement and other tasks, variational inference is utilized to convert the information bottleneck term into a KL divergence that is approximated as a constraint on the mean of the capsule. For supervised learning, class independent mask vector is used for understanding the types of variations synthetically irrespective of the image class, we carry out extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments by tuning the parameter $ beta$ to figure out the relationship between disentanglement, reconstruction and classfication performance. Furthermore, the unsupervised $ beta$-CapsNet and the corresponding dynamic routing algorithm is proposed for learning disentangled capsule in an unsupervised manner, extensive empirical evaluations suggest that our $ beta$-CapsNet achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement performance compared to CapsNet and various baselines on several complex datasets both in supervision and unsupervised scenes.

$β$-Multivariational Autoencoder for Entangled Representation Learning in Video Frames                                                                                  It is crucial to choose actions from an appropriate distribution while learning a sequential decision-making process in which a set of actions is expected given the states and previous reward. Yet, if there are more than two latent variables and every two variables have a covariance value, learning a known prior from data becomes challenging. Because when the data are big and diverse, many posterior estimate methods experience posterior collapse. In this paper, we propose the $ beta$-Multivariational Autoencoder ($ beta$MVAE) to learn a Multivariate Gaussian prior from video frames for use as part of a single object-tracking in form of a decision-making process. We present a novel formulation for object motion in videos with a set of dependent parameters to address a single object-tracking task. The true values of the motion parameters are obtained through data analysis on the training set. The parameters population is then assumed to have a Multivariate Gaussian distribution. The $ beta$MVAE is developed to learn this entangled prior $p = N( mu, Sigma)$ directly from frame patches where the output is the object masks of the frame patches. We devise a bottleneck to estimate the posterior's parameters, i.e. $ mu', Sigma'$. Via a new reparameterization trick, we learn the likelihood $p( hat{x}|z)$ as the object mask of the input. Furthermore, we alter the neural network of $ beta$MVAE with the U-Net architecture and name the new network $ beta$Multivariational U-Net ($ beta$MVUnet). Our networks are trained from scratch via over 85k video frames for 24 ($ beta$MVUnet) and 78 ($ beta$MVAE) million steps. We show that $ beta$MVUnet enhances both posterior estimation and segmentation functioning over the test set. Our code and the trained networks are publicly released.                                                                                  Fatemeh Nouri

$μ$GUIDE: a framework for microstructure imaging via generalized uncertainty-driven inference using deep learning                                                                                  This work proposes $ mu$GUIDE: a general Bayesian framework to estimate posterior distributions of tissue microstructure parameters from any given biophysical model or MRI signal representation, with exemplar demonstration in diffusion-weighted MRI. Harnessing a new deep learning architecture for automatic signal feature selection combined with simulation-based inference and efficient sampling of the posterior distributions, $ mu$GUIDE bypasses the high computational and time cost of conventional Bayesian approaches and does not rely on acquisition constraints to define model-specific summary statistics. The obtained posterior distributions allow to highlight degeneracies present in the model definition and quantify the uncertainty and ambiguity of the estimated parameters.

Designing neural networks for such a platform requires an intricate balance between keeping high predictive performance (accuracy) while achieving low memory and storage usage and inference latency. This is extremely challenging to achieve manually, so in this work, we build a neural architecture search (NAS) system, called $ mu$NAS, to automate the design of such small-yet-powerful MCU-level networks. $ mu$NAS explicitly targets the three primary aspects of resource scarcity of MCUs: the size of RAM, persistent storage and processor speed. $ mu$NAS represents a significant advance in resource-efficient models, especially for 'mid-tier' MCUs with memory requirements ranging from 0.5 KB to 64 KB. We show that on a variety of image classification datasets $ mu$NAS is able to (a) improve top-1 classification accuracy by up to 4.8%, or (b) reduce memory footprint by 4--13x, or (c) reduce the number of multiply-accumulate operations by at least 2x, compared to existing MCU specialist literature and resource-efficient models.

$μ$NCA: Texture Generation with Ultra-Compact Neural Cellular Automata                                                                                  We study the problem of example-based procedural texture synthesis using highly compact models. Given a sample image, we use differentiable programming to train a generative process, parameterised by a recurrent Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) rule. Contrary to the common belief that neural networks should be significantly over-parameterised, we demonstrate that our model architecture and training procedure allows for representing complex texture patterns using just a few hundred learned parameters, making their expressivity comparable to hand-engineered procedural texture generating programs. The smallest models from the proposed $ mu$NCA family scale down to 68 parameters. When using quantisation to one byte per parameter, proposed models can be shrunk to a size range between 588 and 68 bytes. Implementation of a texture generator that uses these parameters to produce images is possible with just a few lines of GLSL or C code.

$μ$VulDeePecker: A Deep Learning-Based System for Multiclass Vulnerability Detection                                                                                  Fine-grained software vulnerability detection is an important and challenging problem. Ideally, a detection system (or detector) not only should be able to detect whether or not a program contains vulnerabilities, but also should be able to pinpoint the type of a vulnerability in question. Existing vulnerability detection methods based on deep learning can detect the presence of vulnerabilities (i.e., addressing the binary classification or detection problem), but cannot pinpoint types of vulnerabilities (i.e., incapable of addressing multiclass classification). In this paper, we propose the first deep learning-based system for multiclass vulnerability detection, dubbed $ mu$VulDeePecker. The key insight underlying $ mu$VulDeePecker is the concept of code attention, which can capture information that can help pinpoint types of vulnerabilities, even when the samples are small. For this purpose, we create a dataset from scratch and use it to evaluate the effectiveness of $ mu$VulDeePecker. Experimental results show that $ mu$VulDeePecker is effective for multiclass vulnerability detection and that accommodating control-dependence (other than data-dependence) can lead to higher detection capabilities.

$ν$-net: Deep Learning for Generalized Biventricular Cardiac Mass and Function Parameters                                                                                  Background: Cardiac MRI derived biventricular mass and function parameters, such as end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), and ventricular mass (VM) are clinically well established. Image segmentation can be challenging and time-consuming, due to the complex anatomy of the human heart. Objectives: This study introduces $ nu$-net (/nju:n$ varepsilon$t/) -- a deep learning approach allowing for fully-automated high quality segmentation of right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) endocardium and epicardium for extraction of cardiac function parameters. Methods: A set consisting of 253 manually segmented cases has been used to train a deep neural network. Subsequently, the network has been evaluated on 4 different multicenter data sets with a total of over 1000 cases. Results: For LV EF the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is 98, 95, and 80 % (95 %), and for RV EF 96, and 87 % (80 %) on the respective data sets (human expert ICCs reported in parenthesis). The LV VM ICC is 95, and 94 % (84 %), and the RV VM ICC is 83, and 83 % (54 %). This study proposes a simple adjustment procedure, allowing for the adaptation to distinct segmentation philosophies. $ nu$-net exhibits state of-the-art performance in terms of dice coefficient. Conclusions: Biventricular mass and function parameters can be determined reliably in high quality by applying a deep neural network for cardiac MRI segmentation, especially in the anatomically complex right ventricle. Adaption to individual segmentation styles by applying a simple adjustment procedure is viable, allowing for the processing of novel data without time-consuming additional training.

$ν$-net: Deep Learning for Generalized Biventricular Cardiac Mass and Function Parameters                                                                                  Background: Cardiac MRI derived biventricular mass and function parameters, such as end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), and ventricular mass (VM) are clinically well established. Image segmentation can be challenging and time-consuming, due to the complex anatomy of the human heart. Objectives: This study introduces $ nu$-net (/nju:n$ varepsilon$t/) -- a deep learning approach allowing for fully-automated high quality segmentation of right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) endocardium and epicardium for extraction of cardiac function parameters. Methods: A set consisting of 253 manually segmented cases has been used to train a deep neural network. Subsequently, the network has been evaluated on 4 different multicenter data sets with a total of over 1000 cases. Results: For LV EF the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is 98, 95, and 80 % (95 %), and for RV EF 96, and 87 % (80 %) on the respective data sets (human expert ICCs reported in parenthesis). The LV VM ICC is 95, and 94 % (84 %), and the RV VM ICC is 83, and 83 % (54 %). This study proposes a simple adjustment procedure, allowing for the adaptation to distinct segmentation philosophies. $ nu$-net exhibits state of-the-art performance in terms of dice coefficient. Conclusions: Biventricular mass and function parameters can be determined reliably in high quality by applying a deep neural network for cardiac MRI segmentation, especially in the anatomically complex right ventricle.

$π$VAE: a stochastic process prior for Bayesian deep learning with MCMC                                                                                  Stochastic processes provide a mathematically elegant way model complex data. In theory, they provide flexible priors over function classes that can encode a wide range of interesting assumptions. In practice, however, efficient inference by optimisation or marginalisation is difficult, a problem further exacerbated with big data and high dimensional input spaces. We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) called the prior encoding variational autoencoder ($ pi$VAE). The $ pi$VAE is finitely exchangeable and Kolmogorov consistent, and thus is a continuous stochastic process. We use $ pi$VAE to learn low dimensional embeddings of function classes. We show that our framework can accurately learn expressive function classes such as Gaussian processes, but also properties of functions to enable statistical inference (such as the integral of a log Gaussian process). For popular tasks, such as spatial interpolation, $ pi$VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Perhaps most usefully, we demonstrate that the low dimensional independently distributed latent space representation learnt provides an elegant and scalable means of performing Bayesian inference for stochastic processes within probabilistic programming languages such as Stan.

$σ$-PCA: a unified neural model for linear and nonlinear principal component analysis                                                                                  Linear principal component analysis (PCA), nonlinear PCA, and linear independent component analysis (ICA) -- those are three methods with single-layer autoencoder formulations for learning linear transformations from data. Linear PCA learns orthogonal transformations (rotations) that orient axes to maximise variance, but it suffers from a subspace rotational indeterminacy: it fails to find a unique rotation for axes that share the same variance. Both nonlinear PCA and linear ICA reduce the subspace indeterminacy from rotational to permutational by maximising statistical independence under the assumption of unit variance. The relationship between all three can be understood by the singular value decomposition of the linear ICA transformation into a sequence of rotation, scale, rotation. Linear PCA learns the first rotation; nonlinear PCA learns the second. The scale is simply the inverse of the standard deviations. The problem is that, in contrast to linear PCA, conventional nonlinear PCA cannot be used directly on the data to learn the first rotation, the first being special as it reduces dimensionality and orders by variances. In this paper, we have identified the cause, and as a solution we propose $ sigma$-PCA: a unified neural model for linear and nonlinear PCA as single-layer autoencoders. One of its key ingredients: modelling not just the rotation but also the scale -- the variances. This model bridges the disparity between linear and nonlinear PCA. And so, like linear PCA, it can learn a semi-orthogonal transformation that reduces dimensionality and orders by variances, but, unlike linear PCA, it does not suffer from rotational indeterminacy.

'A net for everyone': fully personalized and unsupervised neural networks trained with longitudinal data from a single patient                                                                                  With the rise in importance of personalized medicine, we trained personalized neural networks to detect tumor progression in longitudinal datasets. The model was evaluated on two datasets with a total of 64 scans from 32 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Contrast-enhanced T1w sequences of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were used in this study. For each patient, we trained their own neural network using just two images from different timepoints. Our approach uses a Wasserstein-GAN (generative adversarial network), an unsupervised network architecture, to map the differences between the two images. Using this map, the change in tumor volume can be evaluated. Due to the combination of data augmentation and the network architecture, co-registration of the two images is not needed. Furthermore, we do not rely on any additional training data, (manual) annotations or pre-training neural networks. The model received an AUC-score of 0.87 for tumor change. We also introduced a modified RANO criteria, for which an accuracy of 66% can be achieved. We show that using data from just one patient can be used to train deep neural networks to monitor tumor change.

'Adversarial Examples' for Proof-of-Learning                                                                                  In S&P '21, Jia et al. proposed a new concept/mechanism named proof-of-learning (PoL), which allows a prover to demonstrate ownership of a machine learning model by proving integrity of the training procedure. It guarantees that an adversary cannot construct a valid proof with less cost (in both computation and storage) than that made by the prover in generating the proof. A PoL proof includes a set of intermediate models recorded during training, together with the corresponding data points used to obtain each recorded model. Jia et al. claimed that an adversary merely knowing the final model and training dataset cannot efficiently find a set of intermediate models with correct data points. In this paper, however, we show that PoL is vulnerable to ``adversarial examples''! Specifically, in a similar way as optimizing an adversarial example, we could make an arbitrarily-chosen data point ``generate'' a given model, hence efficiently generating intermediate models with correct data points. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that we are able to generate a valid proof with significantly less cost than generating a proof by the prover.

'Almost Sure' Chaotic Properties of Machine Learning Methods                                                                                  It has been demonstrated earlier that universal computation is 'almost surely' chaotic. Machine learning is a form of computational fixed point iteration, iterating over the computable function space. We showcase some properties of this iteration, and establish in general that the iteration is 'almost surely' of chaotic nature. This theory explains the observation in the counter intuitive properties of deep learning methods. This paper demonstrates that these properties are going to be universal to any learning method.                                                                                  Nabarun Mondal

'Auction Learning as a Two Player Game': GANs (?) for Mechanism Design                                                                                  Designing strategyproof, revenue-maximizing auctions is an important task, but it is surprisingly difficult -- even in some seemingly trivial cases, nothing is known about the optimal auction design. Motivated by this lack of progress, a number of recent works have proposed the use of deep neural networks as function approximators for learning strategyproof mechanisms. One of these works is 'Auction Learning as a Two-Player Game', which appeared at ICLR 2021. We discuss this work, situate it in the broader context of deep learning for auctions, explain how it improves over prior techniques, and discuss the future outlook for interactions between modern deep learning and mechanism design.

'Average' Approximates 'First Principal Component'? An Empirical Analysis on Representations from Neural Language Models                                                                                  Contextualized representations based on neural language models have furthered the state of the art in various NLP tasks. Despite its great success, the nature of such representations remains a mystery. In this paper, we present an empirical property of these representations -- 'average' approximates 'first principal component'. Specifically, experiments show that the average of these representations shares almost the same direction as the first principal component of the matrix whose columns are these representations. We believe this explains why the average representation is always a simple yet strong baseline. Our further examinations show that this property also holds in more challenging scenarios, for example, when the representations are from a model right after its random initialization. Therefore, we conjecture that this property is intrinsic to the distribution of representations and not necessarily related to the input structure. We realize that these representations empirically follow a normal distribution for each dimension, and by assuming this is true, we demonstrate that the empirical property can be in fact derived mathematically.

'BNN - BN = ?': Training Binary Neural Networks without Batch Normalization                                                                                  Batch normalization (BN) is a key facilitator and considered essential for state-of-the-art binary neural networks (BNN). However, the BN layer is costly to calculate and is typically implemented with non-binary parameters, leaving a hurdle for the efficient implementation of BNN training. It also introduces undesirable dependence between samples within each batch. Inspired by the latest advance on Batch Normalization Free (BN-Free) training, we extend their framework to training BNNs, and for the first time demonstrate that BNs can be completed removed from BNN training and inference regimes. By plugging in and customizing techniques including adaptive gradient clipping, scale weight standardization, and specialized bottleneck block, a BN-free BNN is capable of maintaining competitive accuracy compared to its BN-based counterpart. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal across diverse BNN backbones and datasets. For example, after removing BNs from the state-of-the-art ReActNets, it can still be trained with our proposed methodology to achieve 92.08%, 68.34%, and 68.0% accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet respectively, with marginal performance drop (0.23%~0.44% on CIFAR and 1.40% on ImageNet).

Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal across diverse BNN backbones and datasets. For example, after removing BNs from the state-of-the-art ReActNets, it can still be trained with our proposed methodology to achieve 92.08%, 68.34%, and 68.0% accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet respectively, with marginal performance drop (0.23%~0.44% on CIFAR and 1.40% on ImageNet).

'CADSketchNet' -- An Annotated Sketch dataset for 3D CAD Model Retrieval with Deep Neural Networks                                                                                  Ongoing advancements in the fields of 3D modelling and digital archiving have led to an outburst in the amount of data stored digitally. Consequently, several retrieval systems have been developed depending on the type of data stored in these databases. However, unlike text data or images, performing a search for 3D models is non-trivial. Among 3D models, retrieving 3D Engineering/CAD models or mechanical components is even more challenging due to the presence of holes, volumetric features, presence of sharp edges etc., which make CAD a domain unto itself. The research work presented in this paper aims at developing a dataset suitable for building a retrieval system for 3D CAD models based on deep learning. 3D CAD models from the available CAD databases are collected, and a dataset of computer-generated sketch data, termed 'CADSketchNet', has been prepared. Additionally, hand-drawn sketches of the components are also added to CADSketchNet. Using the sketch images from this dataset, the paper also aims at evaluating the performance of various retrieval system or a search engine for 3D CAD models that accepts a sketch image as the input query. Many experimental models are constructed and tested on CADSketchNet. These experiments, along with the model architecture, choice of similarity metrics are reported along with the search results.

'Close...but not as good as an educator.' -- Using ChatGPT to provide formative feedback in large-class collaborative learning                                                                                  Delivering personalised, formative feedback to multiple problem-based learning groups in a short time period can be almost impossible. We employed ChatGPT to provide personalised formative feedback in a one-hour Zoom break-out room activity that taught practicing health professionals how to formulate evaluation plans for digital health initiatives. Learners completed an evaluation survey that included Likert scales and open-ended questions that were analysed. Half of the 44 survey respondents had never used ChatGPT before. Overall, respondents found the feedback favourable, described a wide range of group dynamics, and had adaptive responses to the feedback, yet only three groups used the feedback loop to improve their evaluation plans. Future educators can learn from our experience including engineering prompts, providing instructions on how to use ChatGPT, and scaffolding optimal group interactions with ChatGPT. Future researchers should explore the influence of ChatGPT on group dynamics and derive design principles for the use of ChatGPT in collaborative learning.

'Did You Hear That?' Learning to Play Video Games from Audio Cues                                                                                  Game-playing AI research has focused for a long time on learning to play video games from visual input or symbolic information. However, humans benefit from a wider array of sensors which we utilise in order to navigate the world around us. In particular, sounds and music are key to how many of us perceive the world and influence the decisions we make. In this paper, we present initial experiments on game-playing agents learning to play video games solely from audio cues. We expand the Video Game Description Language to allow for audio specification, and the General Video Game AI framework to provide new audio games and an API for learning agents to make use of audio observations. We analyse the games and the audio game design process, include initial results with simple Q~Learning agents, and encourage further research in this area.

'Double vaccinated, 5G boosted!': Learning Attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccination from Social Media                                                                                  To address the vaccine hesitancy which impairs the efforts of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, it is imperative to understand public vaccination attitudes and timely grasp their changes. In spite of reliability and trustworthiness, conventional attitude collection based on surveys is time-consuming and expensive, and cannot follow the fast evolution of vaccination attitudes. We leverage the textual posts on social media to extract and track users' vaccination stances in near real time by proposing a deep learning framework. To address the impact of linguistic features such as sarcasm and irony commonly used in vaccine-related discourses, we integrate into the framework the recent posts of a user's social network neighbours to help detect the user's genuine attitude. Based on our annotated dataset from Twitter, the models instantiated from our framework can increase the performance of attitude extraction by up to 23% compared to state-of-the-art text-only models. Using this framework, we successfully validate the feasibility of using social media to track the evolution of vaccination attitudes in real life. We further show one practical use of our framework by validating the possibility to forecast a user's vaccine hesitancy changes with information perceived from social media.

'Double-DIP': Unsupervised Image Decomposition via Coupled Deep-Image-Priors                                                                                  Many seemingly unrelated computer vision tasks can be viewed as a special case of image decomposition into separate layers. For example, image segmentation (separation into foreground and background layers); transparent layer separation (into reflection and transmission layers); Image dehazing (separation into a clear image and a haze map), and more. In this paper we propose a unified framework for unsupervised layer decomposition of a single image, based on coupled 'Deep-image-Prior' (DIP) networks. It was shown [Ulyanov et al] that the structure of a single DIP generator network is sufficient to capture the low-level statistics of a single image. We show that coupling multiple such DIPs provides a powerful tool for decomposing images into their basic components, for a wide variety of applications.

'Double-DIP': Unsupervised Image Decomposition via Coupled Deep-Image-Priors                                                                                  Many seemingly unrelated computer vision tasks can be viewed as a special case of image decomposition into separate layers. For example, image segmentation (separation into foreground and background layers); transparent layer separation (into reflection and transmission layers); Image dehazing (separation into a clear image and a haze map), and more. In this paper we propose a unified framework for unsupervised layer decomposition of a single image, based on coupled 'Deep-image-Prior' (DIP) networks. It was shown [Ulyanov et al] that the structure of a single DIP generator network is sufficient to capture the low-level statistics of a single image. We show that coupling multiple such DIPs provides a powerful tool for decomposing images into their basic components, for a wide variety of applications.

'Factual' or 'Emotional': Stylized Image Captioning with Adaptive Learning and Attention                                                                                  Generating stylized captions for an image is an emerging topic in image captioning. Given an image as input, it requires the system to generate a caption that has a specific style (e.g., humorous, romantic, positive, and negative) while describing the image content semantically accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel stylized image captioning model that effectively takes both requirements into consideration. To this end, we first devise a new variant of LSTM, named style-factual LSTM, as the building block of our model. It uses two groups of matrices to capture the factual and stylized knowledge, respectively, and automatically learns the word-level weights of the two groups based on previous context. In addition, when we train the model to capture stylized elements, we propose an adaptive learning approach based on a reference factual model, it provides factual knowledge to the model as the model learns from stylized caption labels, and can adaptively compute how much information to supply at each time step. We evaluate our model on two stylized image captioning datasets, which contain humorous/romantic captions and positive/negative captions, respectively. Experiments shows that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, without using extra ground truth supervision.

'Found in Translation': Predicting Outcomes of Complex Organic Chemistry Reactions using Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Models                                                                                  There is an intuitive analogy of an organic chemist's understanding of a compound and a language speaker's understanding of a word. Consequently, it is possible to introduce the basic concepts and analyze potential impacts of linguistic analysis to the world of organic chemistry. In this work, we cast the reaction prediction task as a translation problem by introducing a template-free sequence-to-sequence model, trained end-to-end and fully data-driven. We propose a novel way of tokenization, which is arbitrarily extensible with reaction information. With this approach, we demonstrate results superior to the state-of-the-art solution by a significant margin on the top-1 accuracy. Specifically, our approach achieves an accuracy of 80.1% without relying on auxiliary knowledge such as reaction templates. Also, 66.4% accuracy is reached on a larger and noisier dataset.                                                                                  Costas Bekas

'Garbage In, Garbage Out' Revisited: What Do Machine Learning Application Papers Report About Human-Labeled Training Data?                                                                                  Supervised machine learning, in which models are automatically derived from labeled training data, is only as good as the quality of that data. This study builds on prior work that investigated to what extent 'best practices' around labeling training data were followed in applied ML publications within a single domain (social media platforms). In this paper, we expand by studying publications that apply supervised ML in a far broader spectrum of disciplines, focusing on human-labeled data. We report to what extent a random sample of ML application papers across disciplines give specific details about whether best practices were followed, while acknowledging that a greater range of application fields necessarily produces greater diversity of labeling and annotation methods. Because much of machine learning research and education only focuses on what is done once a 'ground truth' or 'gold standard' of training data is available, it is especially relevant to discuss issues around the equally-important aspect of whether such data is reliable in the first place. This determination becomes increasingly complex when applied to a variety of specialized fields, as labeling can range from a task requiring little-to-no background knowledge to one that must be performed by someone with career expertise.

The saying is adopted and modified based on the ideas from the Eastern and Western philosophers. This position paper discusses the saying in the background of artificial intelligence (AI). Some related subjects, such as the ultimate goals of AI and two levels of knowledge representations, are discussed from the perspective of machine learning. A case study on objective evaluations over multi attributes, a typical problem in the filed of social computing, is given to support the saying for wide applications. A methodology of meta rules is proposed for examining the objectiveness of the evaluations. The possible problems of the saying are also presented.                                                                                  Bao-Gang Hu

'Good Robot!

We address this problem by leveraging the insight that RL models trained to complete one set of tasks can be repurposed to complete related tasks when given just a handful of demonstrations. Based upon this insight, we propose See-SPOT-Run (SSR), a new computational approach to robot learning that enables a robot to complete a variety of real robot tasks in novel problem domains without task-specific training. SSR uses pretrained RL models to create vectors that represent model, task, and action relevance in demonstration and test scenes. SSR then compares these vectors via our Cycle Consistency Distance (CCD) metric to determine the next action to take. SSR completes 58% more task steps and 20% more trials than a baseline few-shot learning method that requires task-specific training. SSR also achieves a four order of magnitude improvement in compute efficiency and a 20% to three order of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to the baseline and to training RL models from scratch. To our knowledge, we are the first to address multi-step tasks from demonstration on a real robot without task-specific training, where both the visual input and action space output are high dimensional.

Now Watch This!': Repurposing Reinforcement Learning for Task-to-Task Transfer                                                                                  Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are not sample efficient to train on multi-step tasks in complex domains, impeding their wider deployment in the real world. We address this problem by leveraging the insight that RL models trained to complete one set of tasks can be repurposed to complete related tasks when given just a handful of demonstrations. Based upon this insight, we propose See-SPOT-Run (SSR), a new computational approach to robot learning that enables a robot to complete a variety of real robot tasks in novel problem domains without task-specific training. SSR uses pretrained RL models to create vectors that represent model, task, and action relevance in demonstration and test scenes. SSR then compares these vectors via our Cycle Consistency Distance (CCD) metric to determine the next action to take. SSR completes 58% more task steps and 20% more trials than a baseline few-shot learning method that requires task-specific training. SSR also achieves a four order of magnitude improvement in compute efficiency and a 20% to three order of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to the baseline and to training RL models from scratch. To our knowledge, we are the first to address multi-step tasks from demonstration on a real robot without task-specific training, where both the visual input and action space output are high dimensional.

'Good Robot!': Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Step Visual Tasks with Sim to Real Transfer                                                                                  Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms struggle with long-horizon tasks where time can be wasted exploring dead ends and task progress may be easily reversed. We develop the SPOT framework, which explores within action safety zones, learns about unsafe regions without exploring them, and prioritizes experiences that reverse earlier progress to learn with remarkable efficiency. The SPOT framework successfully completes simulated trials of a variety of tasks, improving a baseline trial success rate from 13% to 100% when stacking 4 cubes, from 13% to 99% when creating rows of 4 cubes, and from 84% to 95% when clearing toys arranged in adversarial patterns. Efficiency with respect to actions per trial typically improves by 30% or more, while training takes just 1-20k actions, depending on the task. Furthermore, we demonstrate direct sim to real transfer. We are able to create real stacks in 100% of trials with 61% efficiency and real rows in 100% of trials with 59% efficiency by directly loading the simulation-trained model on the real robot with no additional real-world fine-tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of reinforcement learning with successful sim to real transfer applied to long term multi-step tasks such as block-stacking and row-making with consideration of progress reversal.

If successful, such tools in the wrong hands will enable a range of powerful attacks against both humans and software systems (aka machines). This paper documents efforts and findings from a comprehensive experimental study on the impact of deep-learning based speech synthesis attacks on both human listeners and machines such as speaker recognition and voice-signin systems. We find that both humans and machines can be reliably fooled by synthetic speech and that existing defenses against synthesized speech fall short.

'How do urban incidents affect traffic speed?' A Deep Graph Convolutional Network for Incident-driven Traffic Speed Prediction                                                                                  Accurate traffic speed prediction is an important and challenging topic for transportation planning. Previous studies on traffic speed prediction predominately used spatio-temporal and context features for prediction. However, they have not made good use of the impact of urban traffic incidents. In this work, we aim to make use of the information of urban incidents to achieve a better prediction of traffic speed. Our incident-driven prediction framework consists of three processes. First, we propose a critical incident discovery method to discover urban traffic incidents with high impact on traffic speed. Second, we design a binary classifier, which uses deep learning methods to extract the latent incident impact features from the middle layer of the classifier. Combining above methods, we propose a Deep Incident-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (DIGC-Net) to effectively incorporate urban traffic incident, spatio-temporal, periodic and context features for traffic speed prediction. We conduct experiments on two real-world urban traffic datasets of San Francisco and New York City. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model compare to the competing benchmarks.                                                                                  Ben Y. Zhao

A Deep Graph Convolutional Network for Incident-driven Traffic Speed Prediction                                                                                  Accurate traffic speed prediction is an important and challenging topic for transportation planning. Previous studies on traffic speed prediction predominately used spatio-temporal and context features for prediction. However, they have not made good use of the impact of urban traffic incidents. In this work, we aim to make use of the information of urban incidents to achieve a better prediction of traffic speed. Our incident-driven prediction framework consists of three processes. First, we propose a critical incident discovery method to discover urban traffic incidents with high impact on traffic speed. Second, we design a binary classifier, which uses deep learning methods to extract the latent incident impact features from the middle layer of the classifier. Combining above methods, we propose a Deep Incident-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (DIGC-Net) to effectively incorporate urban traffic incident, spatio-temporal, periodic and context features for traffic speed prediction. We conduct experiments on two real-world urban traffic datasets of San Francisco and New York City. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model compare to the competing benchmarks.                                                                                  Tiancheng Guo

'I have vxxx bxx connexxxn!': Facing Packet Loss in Deep Speech Emotion Recognition                                                                                  In applications that use emotion recognition via speech, frame-loss can be a severe issue given manifold applications, where the audio stream loses some data frames, for a variety of reasons like low bandwidth. In this contribution, we investigate for the first time the effects of frame-loss on the performance of emotion recognition via speech. Reproducible extensive experiments are reported on the popular RECOLA corpus using a state-of-the-art end-to-end deep neural network, which mainly consists of convolution blocks and recurrent layers. A simple environment based on a Markov Chain model is used to model the loss mechanism based on two main parameters. We explore matched, mismatched, and multi-condition training settings. As one expects, the matched setting yields the best performance, while the mismatched yields the lowest. Furthermore, frame-loss as a data augmentation technique is introduced as a general-purpose strategy to overcome the effects of frame-loss. It can be used during training, and we observed it to produce models that are more robust against frame-loss in run-time environments.

'In Dialogues We Learn': Towards Personalized Dialogue Without Pre-defined Profiles through In-Dialogue Learning                                                                                  Personalized dialogue systems have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate responses in alignment with different personas. However, most existing approaches rely on pre-defined personal profiles, which are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive to create but also lack flexibility. We propose In-Dialogue Learning (IDL), a fine-tuning framework that enhances the ability of pre-trained large language models to leverage dialogue history to characterize persona for completing personalized dialogue generation tasks without pre-defined profiles. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that IDL brings substantial improvements, with BLEU and ROUGE scores increasing by up to 200% and 247%, respectively. Additionally, the results of human evaluations further validate the efficacy of our proposed method.                                                                                  Chuanqi Cheng

'It's a Match!' -- A Benchmark of Task Affinity Scores for Joint Learning                                                                                  While the promises of Multi-Task Learning (MTL) are attractive, characterizing the conditions of its success is still an open problem in Deep Learning. Some tasks may benefit from being learned together while others may be detrimental to one another. From a task perspective, grouping cooperative tasks while separating competing tasks is paramount to reap the benefits of MTL, i.e., reducing training and inference costs. Therefore, estimating task affinity for joint learning is a key endeavor. Recent work suggests that the training conditions themselves have a significant impact on the outcomes of MTL. Yet, the literature is lacking of a benchmark to assess the effectiveness of tasks affinity estimation techniques and their relation with actual MTL performance. In this paper, we take a first step in recovering this gap by (i) defining a set of affinity scores by both revisiting contributions from previous literature as well presenting new ones and (ii) benchmarking them on the Taskonomy dataset. Our empirical campaign reveals how, even in a small-scale scenario, task affinity scoring does not correlate well with actual MTL performance. Yet, some metrics can be more indicative than others.                                                                                  Dario Rossi

'Jam Me If You Can'': Defeating Jammer with Deep Dueling Neural Network Architecture and Ambient Backscattering Augmented Communications                                                                                  With conventional anti-jamming solutions like frequency hopping or spread spectrum, legitimate transceivers often tend to 'escape' or 'hide' themselves from jammers. These reactive anti-jamming approaches are constrained by the lack of timely knowledge of jamming attacks. Bringing together the latest advances in neural network architectures and ambient backscattering communications, this work allows wireless nodes to effectively 'face' the jammer by first learning its jamming strategy, then adapting the rate or transmitting information right on the jamming signal. Specifically, to deal with unknown jamming attacks, existing work often relies on reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., Q-learning. However, the Q-learning algorithm is notorious for its slow convergence to the optimal policy, especially when the system state and action spaces are large. This makes the Q-learning algorithm pragmatically inapplicable. To overcome this problem, we design a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm using the recent dueling neural network architecture. Our proposed algorithm allows the transmitter to effectively learn about the jammer and attain the optimal countermeasures thousand times faster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Through extensive simulation results, we show that our design (using ambient backscattering and the deep dueling neural network architecture) can improve the average throughput by up to 426% and reduce the packet loss by 24%. By augmenting the ambient backscattering capability on devices and using our algorithm, it is interesting to observe that the (successful) transmission rate increases with the jamming power. Our proposed solution can find its applications in both civil (e.g., ultra-reliable and low-latency communications or URLLC) and military scenarios (to combat both inadvertent and deliberate jamming).

'Jam Me If You Can'': Defeating Jammer with Deep Dueling Neural Network Architecture and Ambient Backscattering Augmented Communications                                                                                  With conventional anti-jamming solutions like frequency hopping or spread spectrum, legitimate transceivers often tend to 'escape' or 'hide' themselves from jammers. These reactive anti-jamming approaches are constrained by the lack of timely knowledge of jamming attacks. Bringing together the latest advances in neural network architectures and ambient backscattering communications, this work allows wireless nodes to effectively 'face' the jammer by first learning its jamming strategy, then adapting the rate or transmitting information right on the jamming signal.

'Killing Me' Is Not a Spoiler: Spoiler Detection Model using Graph Neural Networks with Dependency Relation-Aware Attention Mechanism                                                                                  Several machine learning-based spoiler detection models have been proposed recently to protect users from spoilers on review websites. Although dependency relations between context words are important for detecting spoilers, current attention-based spoiler detection models are insufficient for utilizing dependency relations. To address this problem, we propose a new spoiler detection model called SDGNN that is based on syntax-aware graph neural networks. In the experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets, we show that our SDGNN outperforms the existing spoiler detection models.

'LazImpa': Lazy and Impatient neural agents learn to communicate efficiently                                                                                  Previous work has shown that artificial neural agents naturally develop surprisingly non-efficient codes. This is illustrated by the fact that in a referential game involving a speaker and a listener neural networks optimizing accurate transmission over a discrete channel, the emergent messages fail to achieve an optimal length. Furthermore, frequent messages tend to be longer than infrequent ones, a pattern contrary to the Zipf Law of Abbreviation (ZLA) observed in all natural languages. Here, we show that near-optimal and ZLA-compatible messages can emerge, but only if both the speaker and the listener are modified. We hence introduce a new communication system, 'LazImpa', where the speaker is made increasingly lazy, i.e. avoids long messages, and the listener impatient, i.e.,~seeks to guess the intended content as soon as possible.

'Less Than One'-Shot Learning: Learning N Classes From M<N Samples                                                                                  Deep neural networks require large training sets but suffer from high computational cost and long training times. Training on much smaller training sets while maintaining nearly the same accuracy would be very beneficial. In the few-shot learning setting, a model must learn a new class given only a small number of samples from that class. One-shot learning is an extreme form of few-shot learning where the model must learn a new class from a single example. We propose the `less than one'-shot learning task where models must learn $N$ new classes given only $M<N$ examples and we show that this is achievable with the help of soft labels. We use a soft-label generalization of the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to explore the intricate decision landscapes that can be created in the `less than one'-shot learning setting. We analyze these decision landscapes to derive theoretical lower bounds for separating $N$ classes using $M<N$ soft-label samples and investigate the robustness of the resulting systems.

'Lossless' Compression of Deep Neural Networks: A High-dimensional Neural Tangent Kernel Approach                                                                                  Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are extremely powerful; however, this comes at the price of increased depth and having more parameters per layer, making their training and inference more computationally challenging. In an attempt to address this key limitation, efforts have been devoted to the compression (e.g., sparsification and/or quantization) of these large-scale machine learning models, so that they can be deployed on low-power IoT devices. In this paper, building upon recent advances in neural tangent kernel (NTK) and random matrix theory (RMT), we provide a novel compression approach to wide and fully-connected emph{deep} neural nets. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the high-dimensional regime where the number of data points $n$ and their dimension $p$ are both large, and under a Gaussian mixture model for the data, there exists emph{asymptotic spectral equivalence} between the NTK matrices for a large family of DNN models. This theoretical result enables 'lossless' compression of a given DNN to be performed, in the sense that the compressed network yields asymptotically the same NTK as the original (dense and unquantized) network, with its weights and activations taking values emph{only} in $ { 0, pm 1 }$ up to a scaling.

'Lossless' Compression of Deep Neural Networks: A High-dimensional Neural Tangent Kernel Approach                                                                                  Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are extremely powerful; however, this comes at the price of increased depth and having more parameters per layer, making their training and inference more computationally challenging. In an attempt to address this key limitation, efforts have been devoted to the compression (e.g., sparsification and/or quantization) of these large-scale machine learning models, so that they can be deployed on low-power IoT devices. In this paper, building upon recent advances in neural tangent kernel (NTK) and random matrix theory (RMT), we provide a novel compression approach to wide and fully-connected emph{deep} neural nets. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the high-dimensional regime where the number of data points $n$ and their dimension $p$ are both large, and under a Gaussian mixture model for the data, there exists emph{asymptotic spectral equivalence} between the NTK matrices for a large family of DNN models. This theoretical result enables 'lossless' compression of a given DNN to be performed, in the sense that the compressed network yields asymptotically the same NTK as the original (dense and unquantized) network, with its weights and activations taking values emph{only} in $ { 0, pm 1 }$ up to a scaling.

'Machine LLRning': Learning to Softly Demodulate                                                                                  Soft demodulation, or demapping, of received symbols back into their conveyed soft bits, or bit log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), is at the very heart of any modern receiver. In this paper, a trainable universal neural network-based demodulator architecture, dubbed 'LLRnet', is introduced. LLRnet facilitates an improved performance with significantly reduced overall computational complexity. For instance for the commonly used quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), LLRnet demonstrates LLR estimates approaching the optimal log maximum a-posteriori inference with an order of magnitude less operations than that of the straightforward exact implementation. Link-level simulation examples for the application of LLRnet to 5G-NR and DVB-S.2 are provided. LLRnet is a (yet another) powerful example for the usefulness of applying machine learning to physical layer design.

'Mama Always Had a Way of Explaining Things So I Could Understand'': A Dialogue Corpus for Learning to Construct Explanations                                                                                  As AI is more and more pervasive in everyday life, humans have an increasing demand to understand its behavior and decisions. Most research on explainable AI builds on the premise that there is one ideal explanation to be found. In fact, however, everyday explanations are co-constructed in a dialogue between the person explaining (the explainer) and the specific person being explained to (the explainee). In this paper, we introduce a first corpus of dialogical explanations to enable NLP research on how humans explain as well as on how AI can learn to imitate this process. The corpus consists of 65 transcribed English dialogues from the Wired video series emph{5 Levels}, explaining 13 topics to five explainees of different proficiency. All 1550 dialogue turns have been manually labeled by five independent professionals for the topic discussed as well as for the dialogue act and the explanation move performed. We analyze linguistic patterns of explainers and explainees, and we explore differences across proficiency levels. BERT-based baseline results indicate that sequence information helps predicting topics, acts, and moves effectively                                                                                  Milad Alshomary

'Memory foam' approach to unsupervised learning                                                                                  We propose an alternative approach to construct an artificial learning system, which naturally learns in an unsupervised manner. Its mathematical prototype is a dynamical system, which automatically shapes its vector field in response to the input signal. The vector field converges to a gradient of a multi-dimensional probability density distribution of the input process, taken with negative sign. The most probable patterns are represented by the stable fixed points, whose basins of attraction are formed automatically. The performance of this system is illustrated with musical signals.                                                                                  Christopher J. Marsden

'Moving On' -- Investigating Inventors' Ethnic Origins Using Supervised Learning                                                                                  Patent data provides rich information about technical inventions, but does not disclose the ethnic origin of inventors. In this paper, I use supervised learning techniques to infer this information. To do so, I construct a dataset of 95'202 labeled names and train an artificial recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory (LSTM) to predict ethnic origins based on names. The trained network achieves an overall performance of 91% across 17 ethnic origins. I use this model to classify and investigate the ethnic origins of 2.68 million inventors and provide novel descriptive evidence regarding their ethnic origin composition over time and across countries and technological fields. The global ethnic origin composition has become more diverse over the last decades, which was mostly due to a relative increase of Asian origin inventors. Furthermore, the prevalence of foreign-origin inventors is especially high in the USA, but has also increased in other high-income economies. This increase was mainly driven by an inflow of non-western inventors into emerging high-technology fields for the USA, but not for other high-income countries.

'Name that manufacturer'. Relating image acquisition bias with task complexity when training deep learning models: experiments on head CT                                                                                  As interest in applying machine learning techniques for medical images continues to grow at a rapid pace, models are starting to be developed and deployed for clinical applications. In the clinical AI model development lifecycle (described by Lu et al. [1]), a crucial phase for machine learning scientists and clinicians is the proper design and collection of the data cohort. The ability to recognize various forms of biases and distribution shifts in the dataset is critical at this step. While it remains difficult to account for all potential sources of bias, techniques can be developed to identify specific types of bias in order to mitigate their impact. In this work we analyze how the distribution of scanner manufacturers in a dataset can contribute to the overall bias of deep learning models. We evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNN) for both classification and segmentation tasks, specifically two state-of-the-art models: ResNet [2] for classification and U-Net [3] for segmentation. We demonstrate that CNNs can learn to distinguish the imaging scanner manufacturer and that this bias can substantially impact model performance for both classification and segmentation tasks. By creating an original synthesis dataset of brain data mimicking the presence of more or less subtle lesions we also show that this bias is related to the difficulty of the task. Recognition of such bias is critical to develop robust, generalizable models that will be crucial for clinical applications in real-world data distributions.

'Oddball SGD': Novelty Driven Stochastic Gradient Descent for Training Deep Neural Networks                                                                                  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is arguably the most popular of the machine learning methods applied to training deep neural networks (DNN) today. It has recently been demonstrated that SGD can be statistically biased so that certain elements of the training set are learned more rapidly than others. In this article, we place SGD into a feedback loop whereby the probability of selection is proportional to error magnitude. This provides a novelty-driven oddball SGD process that learns more rapidly than traditional SGD by prioritising those elements of the training set with the largest novelty (error). In our DNN example, oddball SGD trains some 50x faster than regular SGD.                                                                                  Andrew J. R. Simpson
'One size doesn't fit all': Learning how many Examples to use for In-Context Learning for Improved Text Classification                                                                                  Predictive models in natural language processing (NLP) have evolved from training models from scratch to fine-tuning pre-trained models with labelled data. An extreme form of this fine-tuning involves in-context learning (ICL), where the output of a pre-trained generative model (frozen decoder parameters) is controlled only with variations in the input strings (called instructions or prompts). An important component of ICL is the use of a small number of labelled data instances as examples in the prompt. While existing work uses a static number of examples during inference for each data instance, in this paper we propose a novel methodology of dynamically adapting the number of examples as per the data. This is analogous to the use of a variable-sized neighborhood in k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. In our proposed workflow of adaptive ICL (AICL), the number of demonstrations to employ during the inference on a particular data instance is predicted by the Softmax posteriors of a classifier. The parameters of this classifier are fitted on the optimal number of examples in ICL required to correctly infer the label of each instance in the training set with the hypothesis that a test instance that is similar to a training instance should use the same (or a closely matching) number of few-shot examples. Our experiments show that our AICL method results in improvement in text classification task on several standard datasets.

'Place-cell' emergence and learning of invariant data with restricted Boltzmann machines: breaking and dynamical restoration of continuous symmetries in the weight space                                                                                  Distributions of data or sensory stimuli often enjoy underlying invariances. How and to what extent those symmetries are captured by unsupervised learning methods is a relevant question in machine learning and in computational neuroscience. We study here, through a combination of numerical and analytical tools, the learning dynamics of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), a neural network paradigm for representation learning. As learning proceeds from a random configuration of the network weights, we show the existence of, and characterize a symmetry-breaking phenomenon, in which the latent variables acquire receptive fields focusing on limited parts of the invariant manifold supporting the data. The symmetry is restored at large learning times through the diffusion of the receptive field over the invariant manifold; hence, the RBM effectively spans a continuous attractor in the space of network weights. This symmetry-breaking phenomenon takes place only if the amount of data available for training exceeds some critical value, depending on the network size and the intensity of symmetry-induced correlations in the data; below this 'retarded-learning' threshold, the network weights are essentially noisy and overfit the data.

'Prompt-Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA)' Metal Spectral Classification using Deep Learning Method                                                                                  There is a pressing market demand to minimize the test time of Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) spectra measurement machine, so that it could function as an instant material analyzer, e.g. to classify waste samples instantaneously and determine the best recycling method based on the detected compositions of the testing sample. This article introduces a new development of the deep learning classification and contrive to reduce the test time for PGNAA machine. We propose both Random Sampling Methods and Class Activation Map (CAM) to generate 'downsized' samples and train the CNN model continuously. Random Sampling Methods (RSM) aims to reduce the measuring time within a sample, and Class Activation Map (CAM) is for filtering out the less important energy range of the downsized samples. We shorten the overall PGNAA measuring time down to 2.5 seconds while ensuring the accuracy is around 96.88 % for our dataset with 12 different species of substances. Compared with classifying different species of materials, it requires more test time (sample count rate) for substances having the same elements to archive good accuracy. For example, the classification of copper alloys requires nearly 24 seconds test time to reach 98 % accuracy.

Data coming from sensor networks are currently combined with sensor fusion and AI algorithms to drive innovation in fields such as self-driving cars. Data from these sensors can be utilized in numerous use cases, including alerts in safety systems of urban settings, for events such as gun shots and explosions. Moreover, diverse types of sensors, such as sound sensors, can be utilized in low-light conditions or at locations where a camera is not available. This paper investigates the potential of the utilization of sound-sensor data in an urban context. Technically, we propose a novel approach of classifying sound data using the Wigner-Ville distribution and Convolutional Neural Networks. In this paper, we report on the performance of the approach on open-source datasets. The concept and work presented is based on my doctoral thesis, which was performed as part of the Engineering Doctorate program in Data Science at the University of Eindhoven, in collaboration with the Dutch National Police.

'Subverting the Jewtocracy': Online Antisemitism Detection Using Multimodal Deep Learning                                                                                  The exponential rise of online social media has enabled the creation, distribution, and consumption of information at an unprecedented rate. However, it has also led to the burgeoning of various forms of online abuse. Increasing cases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of its socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like racism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a machine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online antisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting signals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling multiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any publicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect and label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and Gab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that detects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism category using text and images from posts. We perform an extensive set of experiments on the two datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed system. Finally, we also present a qualitative analysis of our study.                                                                                  Mohit Chandra

'Task-relevant autoencoding' enhances machine learning for human neuroscience                                                                                  In human neuroscience, machine learning can help reveal lower-dimensional neural representations relevant to subjects' behavior. However, state-of-the-art models typically require large datasets to train, so are prone to overfitting on human neuroimaging data that often possess few samples but many input dimensions. Here, we capitalized on the fact that the features we seek in human neuroscience are precisely those relevant to subjects' behavior. We thus developed a Task-Relevant Autoencoder via Classifier Enhancement (TRACE), and tested its ability to extract behaviorally-relevant, separable representations compared to a standard autoencoder, a variational autoencoder, and principal component analysis for two severely truncated machine learning datasets. We then evaluated all models on fMRI data from 59 subjects who observed animals and objects.

'Task-relevant autoencoding' enhances machine learning for human neuroscience                                                                                  In human neuroscience, machine learning can help reveal lower-dimensional neural representations relevant to subjects' behavior. However, state-of-the-art models typically require large datasets to train, so are prone to overfitting on human neuroimaging data that often possess few samples but many input dimensions. Here, we capitalized on the fact that the features we seek in human neuroscience are precisely those relevant to subjects' behavior. We thus developed a Task-Relevant Autoencoder via Classifier Enhancement (TRACE), and tested its ability to extract behaviorally-relevant, separable representations compared to a standard autoencoder, a variational autoencoder, and principal component analysis for two severely truncated machine learning datasets. We then evaluated all models on fMRI data from 59 subjects who observed animals and objects.

While research communities have focused on creating state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation and the associated challenges to accuracy, fairness, accountability, and transparency that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain under examined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature and provide a detailed case study covering the development, implementation, and evaluation of Sepsis Watch, a machine learning-driven tool that assists hospital clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. We, the team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts. Rather than focusing on model interpretability to ensure a fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for designing machine learning systems. Our work underscores the limits of model interpretability as a solution to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability in practice. Instead, our work demonstrates other means and goals to achieve FATML values in design and in practice.

'The Squawk Bot': Joint Learning of Time Series and Text Data Modalities for Automated Financial Information Filtering                                                                                  Multimodal analysis that uses numerical time series and textual corpora as input data sources is becoming a promising approach, especially in the financial industry. However, the main focus of such analysis has been on achieving high prediction accuracy while little effort has been spent on the important task of understanding the association between the two data modalities. Performance on the time series hence receives little explanation though human-understandable textual information is available. In this work, we address the problem of given a numerical time series, and a general corpus of textual stories collected in the same period of the time series, the task is to timely discover a succinct set of textual stories associated with that time series. Towards this goal, we propose a novel multi-modal neural model called MSIN that jointly learns both numerical time series and categorical text articles in order to unearth the association between them. Through multiple steps of data interrelation between the two data modalities, MSIN learns to focus on a small subset of text articles that best align with the performance in the time series. This succinct set is timely discovered and presented as recommended documents, acting as automated information filtering, for the given time series. We empirically evaluate the performance of our model on discovering relevant news articles for two stock time series from Apple and Google companies, along with the daily news articles collected from the Thomson Reuters over a period of seven consecutive years. The experimental results demonstrate that MSIN achieves up to 84.9% and 87.2% in recalling the ground truth articles respectively to the two examined time series, far more superior to state-of-the-art algorithms that rely on conventional attention mechanism in deep learning.

'The Sum of Its Parts': Joint Learning of Word and Phrase Representations with Autoencoders                                                                                  Recently, there has been a lot of effort to represent words in continuous vector spaces. Those representations have been shown to capture both semantic and syntactic information about words. However, distributed representations of phrases remain a challenge. We introduce a novel model that jointly learns word vector representations and their summation. Word representations are learnt using the word co-occurrence statistical information. To embed sequences of words (i.e. phrases) with different sizes into a common semantic space, we propose to average word vector representations. In contrast with previous methods which reported a posteriori some compositionality aspects by simple summation, we simultaneously train words to sum, while keeping the maximum information from the original vectors. We evaluate the quality of the word representations on several classical word evaluation tasks, and we introduce a novel task to evaluate the quality of the phrase representations. While our distributed representations compete with other methods of learning word representations on word evaluations, we show that they give better performance on the phrase evaluation. Such representations of phrases could be interesting for many tasks in natural language processing.                                                                                  Rémi Lebret

When it comes to dairy farming cattle is an indispensable animal. According to the literature surveys almost 3.9 million cattle and calves die in a year due to different types of diseases. The causes of diseases are mainly bacteria, parasites, fungi, chemical poisons and etc. Infectious diseases can be a greatest threat to livestock health. The mortality rate of cattle causes a huge impact on social, economic and environmental damage. In order to decrease this negative impact, the proposal implements a cross-platform mobile application to easily analyze and identify the diseases which cattle suffer from and give them a solution and also to identify the cattle breeds. The mobile application is designed to identify the breeds by analyzing the images of the cattle and identify diseases after analyzing the videos and the images of affected areas. Then make a model to identify the weight and the age of a particular cow and suggest the best dose of the medicine to the identified disease.

'Train one, Classify one, Teach one' -- Cross-surgery transfer learning for surgical step recognition                                                                                  Prior work demonstrated the ability of machine learning to automatically recognize surgical workflow steps from videos. However, these studies focused on only a single type of procedure. In this work, we analyze, for the first time, surgical step recognition on four different laparoscopic surgeries: Cholecystectomy, Right Hemicolectomy, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Appendectomy. Inspired by the traditional apprenticeship model, in which surgical training is based on the Halstedian method, we paraphrase the 'see one, do one, teach one' approach for the surgical intelligence domain as 'train one, classify one, teach one'. In machine learning, this approach is often referred to as transfer learning. To analyze the impact of transfer learning across different laparoscopic procedures, we explore various time-series architectures and examine their performance on each target domain. We introduce a new architecture, the Time-Series Adaptation Network (TSAN), an architecture optimized for transfer learning of surgical step recognition, and we show how TSAN can be pre-trained using self-supervised learning on a Sequence Sorting task. Such pre-training enables TSAN to learn workflow steps of a new laparoscopic procedure type from only a small number of labeled samples from the target procedure. Our proposed architecture leads to better performance compared to other possible architectures, reaching over 90% accuracy when transferring from laparoscopic Cholecystectomy to the other three procedure types.

'Understanding Robustness Lottery': A Geometric Visual Comparative Analysis of Neural Network Pruning Approaches                                                                                  Deep learning approaches have provided state-of-the-art performance in many applications by relying on large and overparameterized neural networks. However, such networks have been shown to be very brittle and are difficult to deploy on resource-limited platforms. Model pruning, i.e., reducing the size of the network, is a widely adopted strategy that can lead to a more robust and compact model. Many heuristics exist for model pruning, but empirical studies show that some heuristics improve performance whereas others can make models more brittle or have other side effects. This work aims to shed light on how different pruning methods alter the network's internal feature representation and the corresponding impact on model performance. To facilitate a comprehensive comparison and characterization of the high-dimensional model feature space, we introduce a visual geometric analysis of feature representations. We decomposed and evaluated a set of critical geometric concepts from the common adopted classification loss, and used them to design a visualization system to compare and highlight the impact of pruning on model performance and feature representation. The proposed tool provides an environment for in-depth comparison of pruning methods and a comprehensive understanding of how model response to common data corruption. By leveraging the proposed visualization, machine learning researchers can reveal the similarities between pruning methods and redundant in robustness evaluation benchmarks, obtain geometric insights about the differences between pruned models that achieve superior robustness performance, and identify samples that are robust or fragile to model pruning and common data corruption to model pruning and data corruption but also obtain insights and explanations on how some pruned models achieve superior robustness performance.

'What happens if...' Learning to Predict the Effect of Forces in Images                                                                                  What happens if one pushes a cup sitting on a table toward the edge of the table? How about pushing a desk against a wall? In this paper, we study the problem of understanding the movements of objects as a result of applying external forces to them. For a given force vector applied to a specific location in an image, our goal is to predict long-term sequential movements caused by that force. Doing so entails reasoning about scene geometry, objects, their attributes, and the physical rules that govern the movements of objects. We design a deep neural network model that learns long-term sequential dependencies of object movements while taking into account the geometry and appearance of the scene by combining Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. Training our model requires a large-scale dataset of object movements caused by external forces. To build a dataset of forces in scenes, we reconstructed all images in SUN RGB-D dataset in a physics simulator to estimate the physical movements of objects caused by external forces applied to them. Our Forces in Scenes (ForScene) dataset contains 10,335 images in which a variety of external forces are applied to different types of objects resulting in more than 65,000 object movements represented in 3D. Our experimental evaluations show that the challenging task of predicting long-term movements of objects as their reaction to external forces is possible from a single image.

'What is Relevant in a Text Document?': An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach                                                                                  Text documents can be described by a number of abstract concepts such as semantic category, writing style, or sentiment. Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications.

'What's This?' -- Learning to Segment Unknown Objects from Manipulation Sequences                                                                                  We present a novel framework for self-supervised grasped object segmentation with a robotic manipulator. Our method successively learns an agnostic foreground segmentation followed by a distinction between manipulator and object solely by observing the motion between consecutive RGB frames. In contrast to previous approaches, we propose a single, end-to-end trainable architecture which jointly incorporates motion cues and semantic knowledge. Furthermore, while the motion of the manipulator and the object are substantial cues for our algorithm, we present means to robustly deal with distraction objects moving in the background, as well as with completely static scenes. Our method neither depends on any visual registration of a kinematic robot or 3D object models, nor on precise hand-eye calibration or any additional sensor data. By extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the superiority of our framework and provide detailed insights on its capability of dealing with the aforementioned extreme cases of motion. We also show that training a semantic segmentation network with the automatically labeled data achieves results on par with manually annotated training data.

Our method successively learns an agnostic foreground segmentation followed by a distinction between manipulator and object solely by observing the motion between consecutive RGB frames.

'Who is Driving around Me?' Unique Vehicle Instance Classification using Deep Neural Features                                                                                  Being aware of other traffic is a prerequisite for self-driving cars to operate in the real world. In this paper, we show how the intrinsic feature maps of an object detection CNN can be used to uniquely identify vehicles from a dash-cam feed. Feature maps of a pretrained `YOLO' network are used to create 700 deep integrated feature signatures (DIFS) from 20 different images of 35 vehicles from a high resolution dataset and 340 signatures from 20 different images of 17 vehicles of a lower resolution tracking benchmark dataset. The YOLO network was trained to classify general object categories, e.g. classify a detected object as a `car' or `truck'. 5-Fold nearest neighbor (1NN) classification was used on DIFS created from feature maps in the middle layers of the network to correctly identify unique vehicles at a rate of 96.7 % for the high resolution data and with a rate of 86.8 % for the lower resolution data. We conclude that a deep neural detection network trained to distinguish between different classes can be successfully used to identify different instances belonging to the same class, through the creation of deep integrated feature signatures (DIFS).

'Wikily' Supervised Neural Translation Tailored to Cross-Lingual Tasks                                                                                  We present a simple but effective approach for leveraging Wikipedia for neural machine translation as well as cross-lingual tasks of image captioning and dependency parsing without using any direct supervision from external parallel data or supervised models in the target language. We show that first sentences and titles of linked Wikipedia pages, as well as cross-lingual image captions, are strong signals for a seed parallel data to extract bilingual dictionaries and cross-lingual word embeddings for mining parallel text from Wikipedia. Our final model achieves high BLEU scores that are close to or sometimes higher than strong supervised baselines in low-resource languages; e.g. supervised BLEU of 4.0 versus 12.1 from our model in English-to-Kazakh. Moreover, we tailor our wikily supervised translation models to unsupervised image captioning, and cross-lingual dependency parser transfer. In image captioning, we train a multi-tasking machine translation and image captioning pipeline for Arabic and English from which the Arabic training data is a translated version of the English captioning data, using our wikily-supervised translation models. Our captioning results on Arabic are slightly better than that of its supervised model. In dependency parsing, we translate a large amount of monolingual text, and use it as artificial training data in an annotation projection framework. We show that our model outperforms recent work on cross-lingual transfer of dependency parsers.                                                                                  Derry Tanti Wijaya

'You Can't Fix What You Can't Measure': Privately Measuring Demographic Performance Disparities in Federated Learning                                                                                  As in traditional machine learning models, models trained with federated learning may exhibit disparate performance across demographic groups. Model holders must identify these disparities to mitigate undue harm to the groups. However, measuring a model's performance in a group requires access to information about group membership which, for privacy reasons, often has limited availability. We propose novel locally differentially private mechanisms to measure differences in performance across groups while protecting the privacy of group membership. To analyze the effectiveness of the mechanisms, we bound their error in estimating a disparity when optimized for a given privacy budget. Our results show that the error rapidly decreases for realistic numbers of participating clients, demonstrating that, contrary to what prior work suggested, protecting privacy is not necessarily in conflict with identifying performance disparities of federated models.

Further, we predict the performance accuracy of the recommended architecture on the given unknown dataset, without the need for training the model. We propose a model encoder approach to learn a fixed length representation of deep learning architectures along with its hyperparameters, in an unsupervised fashion. We manually curate a repository of image datasets with corresponding known deep learning models and show that the predicted accuracy is a good estimator of the actual accuracy.

'Zero-Shot' Super-Resolution using Deep Internal Learning                                                                                  Deep Learning has led to a dramatic leap in Super-Resolution (SR) performance in the past few years. However, being supervised, these SR methods are restricted to specific training data, where the acquisition of the low-resolution (LR) images from their high-resolution (HR) counterparts is predetermined (e.g., bicubic downscaling), without any distracting artifacts (e.g., sensor noise, image compression, non-ideal PSF, etc). Real LR images, however, rarely obey these restrictions, resulting in poor SR results by SotA (State of the Art) methods. In this paper we introduce 'Zero-Shot' SR, which exploits the power of Deep Learning, but does not rely on prior training. We exploit the internal recurrence of information inside a single image, and train a small image-specific CNN at test time, on examples extracted solely from the input image itself. As such, it can adapt itself to different settings per image. This allows to perform SR of real old photos, noisy images, biological data, and other images where the acquisition process is unknown or non-ideal. On such images, our method outperforms SotA CNN-based SR methods, as well as previous unsupervised SR methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unsupervised CNN-based SR method.                                                                                  Assaf Shocher

(ASNA) An Attention-based Siamese-Difference Neural Network with Surrogate Ranking Loss function for Perceptual Image Quality Assessment                                                                                  Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) that leverage the adversarial training framework for image restoration and enhancement have significantly improved the processed images' sharpness. Surprisingly, although these DCNNs produced crispier images than other methods visually, they may get a lower quality score when popular measures are employed for evaluating them. Therefore it is necessary to develop a quantitative metric to reflect their performances, which is well-aligned with the perceived quality of an image. Famous quantitative metrics such as Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), The structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and Perceptual Index (PI) are not well-correlated with the mean opinion score (MOS) for an image, especially for the neural networks trained with adversarial loss functions. This paper has proposed a convolutional neural network using an extension architecture of the traditional Siamese network so-called Siamese-Difference neural network.

(ASNA) An Attention-based Siamese-Difference Neural Network with Surrogate Ranking Loss function for Perceptual Image Quality Assessment                                                                                  Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) that leverage the adversarial training framework for image restoration and enhancement have significantly improved the processed images' sharpness. Surprisingly, although these DCNNs produced crispier images than other methods visually, they may get a lower quality score when popular measures are employed for evaluating them. Therefore it is necessary to develop a quantitative metric to reflect their performances, which is well-aligned with the perceived quality of an image. Famous quantitative metrics such as Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), The structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and Perceptual Index (PI) are not well-correlated with the mean opinion score (MOS) for an image, especially for the neural networks trained with adversarial loss functions. This paper has proposed a convolutional neural network using an extension architecture of the traditional Siamese network so-called Siamese-Difference neural network. We have equipped this architecture with the spatial and channel-wise attention mechanism to increase our method's performance. Finally, we employed an auxiliary loss function to train our model. The suggested additional cost function surrogates ranking loss to increase Spearman's rank correlation coefficient while it is differentiable concerning the neural network parameters. Our method achieved superior performance in textbf{ textit{NTIRE 2021 Perceptual Image Quality Assessment}} Challenge.

(Almost) Free Incentivized Exploration from Decentralized Learning Agents                                                                                  Incentivized exploration in multi-armed bandits (MAB) has witnessed increasing interests and many progresses in recent years, where a principal offers bonuses to agents to do explorations on her behalf. However, almost all existing studies are confined to temporary myopic agents. In this work, we break this barrier and study incentivized exploration with multiple and long-term strategic agents, who have more complicated behaviors that often appear in real-world applications. An important observation of this work is that strategic agents' intrinsic needs of learning benefit (instead of harming) the principal's explorations by providing 'free pulls'. Moreover, it turns out that increasing the population of agents significantly lowers the principal's burden of incentivizing. The key and somewhat surprising insight revealed from our results is that when there are sufficiently many learning agents involved, the exploration process of the principal can be (almost) free. Our main results are built upon three novel components which may be of independent interest: (1) a simple yet provably effective incentive-provision strategy; (2) a carefully crafted best arm identification algorithm for rewards aggregated under unequal confidences; (3) a high-probability finite-time lower bound of UCB algorithms. Experimental results are provided to complement the theoretical analysis.                                                                                  Chengshuai Shi

(DE)^2 CO: Deep Depth Colorization                                                                                  The ability to classify objects is fundamental for robots. Besides knowledge about their visual appearance, captured by the RGB channel, robots heavily need also depth information to make sense of the world. While the use of deep networks on RGB robot images has benefited from the plethora of results obtained on databases like ImageNet, using convnets on depth images requires mapping them into three dimensional channels. This transfer learning procedure makes them processable by pre-trained deep architectures. Current mappings are based on heuristic assumptions over preprocessing steps and on what depth properties should be most preserved, resulting often in cumbersome data visualizations, and in sub-optimal performance in terms of generality and recognition results. Here we take an alternative route and we attempt instead to learn an optimal colorization mapping for any given pre-trained architecture, using as training data a reference RGB-D database. We propose a deep network architecture, exploiting the residual paradigm, that learns how to map depth data to three channel images. A qualitative analysis of the images obtained with this approach clearly indicates that learning the optimal mapping preserves the richness of depth information better than current hand-crafted approaches. Experiments on the Washington, JHUIT-50 and BigBIRD public benchmark databases, using CaffeNet, VGG16, GoogleNet, and ResNet50 clearly showcase the power of our approach, with gains in performance of up to 16% compared to state of the art competitors on the depth channel only, leading to top performances when dealing with RGB-D data                                                                                  B.

(Debiased) Contrastive Learning Loss for Recommendation (Technical Report)                                                                                  In this paper, we perform a systemic examination of the recommendation losses, including listwise (softmax), pairwise(BPR), and pointwise (mean-squared error, MSE, and Cosine Contrastive Loss, CCL) losses through the lens of contrastive learning. We introduce and study both debiased InfoNCE and mutual information neural estimator (MINE), for the first time, under the recommendation setting. We also relate and differentiate these two losses with the BPR loss through the lower bound analysis. Furthermore, we present the debiased pointwise loss (for both MSE and CCL) and theoretically certify both iALS and EASE, two of the most popular linear models, are inherently debiased. The empirical experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the debiased losses and newly introduced mutual-information losses outperform the existing (biased) ones.

(ML)$^2$P-Encoder: On Exploration of Channel-Class Correlation for Multi-Label Zero-Shot Learning                                                                                   Recent studies usually approach multi-label zero-shot learning (MLZSL) with visual-semantic mapping on spatial-class correlation, which can be computationally costly, and worse still, fails to capture fine-grained class-specific semantics. We observe that different channels may usually have different sensitivities on classes, which can correspond to specific semantics. Such an intrinsic channel-class correlation suggests a potential alternative for the more accurate and class-harmonious feature representations. In this paper, our interest is to fully explore the power of channel-class correlation as the unique base for MLZSL. Specifically, we propose a light yet efficient Multi-Label Multi-Layer Perceptron-based Encoder, dubbed (ML)^2P-Encoder, to extract and preserve channel-wise semantics. We reorganize the generated feature maps into several groups, of which each of them can be trained independently with (ML)^2P-Encoder. On top of that, a global group-wise attention module is further designed to build the multi-label specific class relationships among different classes, which eventually fulfills a novel Channel-Class Correlation MLZSL framework (C^3-MLZSL). Extensive experiments on large-scale MLZSL benchmarks including NUS-WIDE and Open-Images-V4 demonstrate the superiority of our model against other representative state-of-the-art models.

This paper develops a method to uncover the values consistent with observed allocation decisions. We use machine learning methods to estimate how much each individual benefits from an intervention, and then reconcile its allocation with (i) the welfare weights assigned to different people; (ii) heterogeneous treatment effects of the intervention; and (iii) weights on different outcomes. We demonstrate this approach by analyzing Mexico's PROGRESA anti-poverty program. The analysis reveals that while the program prioritized certain subgroups -- such as indigenous households -- the fact that those groups benefited more implies that they were in fact assigned a lower welfare weight. The PROGRESA case illustrates how the method makes it possible to audit existing policies, and to design future policies that better align with values.

(Machine) Learning from the COVID-19 Lockdown about Electricity Market Performance with a Large Share of Renewables                                                                                  The negative demand shock due to the COVID-19 lockdown has reduced net demand for electricity -- system demand less amount of energy produced by intermittent renewables, hydroelectric units, and net imports -- that must be served by controllable generation units. Under normal demand conditions, introducing additional renewable generation capacity reduces net demand. Consequently, the lockdown can provide insights about electricity market performance with a large share of renewables. We find that although the lockdown reduced average day-ahead prices in Italy by 45%, re-dispatch costs increased by 73%, both relative to the average of the same magnitude for the same period in previous years. We estimate a deep-learning model using data from 2017--2019 and find that predicted re-dispatch costs during the lockdown period are only 26% higher than the same period in previous years. We argue that the difference between actual and predicted lockdown period re-dispatch costs is the result of increased opportunities for suppliers with controllable units to exercise market power in the re-dispatch market in these persistently low net demand conditions. Our results imply that without grid investments and other technologies to manage low net demand conditions, an increased share of intermittent renewables is likely to increase costs of maintaining a reliable grid.

(Machine) Learning to Be Like Thee?

ML-trained algorithms moral decisions are ubiquitous in human society. Sometimes reverting the societal advances governments, NGOs and civil society have achieved with great effort in the last decades or are yet on the path to be achieved. While their decisions have an incommensurable impact on human societies, these algorithms are within the least educated agents known (data incomplete, un-inclusive, or biased). ML algorithms are not something separate from our human idiosyncrasy but an enactment of our most implicit prejudices and biases. Some research is devoted to responsibility assignment as a strategy to tackle immoral AI behaviour. Yet this paper argues that the solution for AI ethical decision-making resides in algorithm education (as opposed to the training) of ML. Drawing from an analogy between ML and child education for social responsibility, the paper offers clear directions for responsible and sustainable AI design, specifically with respect to how to educate algorithms to decide ethically.

In this paper, we compare the standard 'fully supervised' approach (that relies on knowledge of event-by-event truth-level labels) with a recent proposal that instead utilizes class ratios as the only discriminating information provided during training. This so-called 'weakly supervised' technique has access to less information than the fully supervised method and yet is still able to yield impressive discriminating power. In addition, weak supervision seems particularly well suited to particle physics since quantum mechanics is incompatible with the notion of mapping an individual event onto any single Feynman diagram. We examine the technique in detail -- both analytically and numerically -- with a focus on the robustness to issues of mischaracterizing the training samples. Weakly supervised networks turn out to be remarkably insensitive to systematic mismodeling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the event level outputs for weakly versus fully supervised networks are probing different kinematics, even though the numerical quality metrics are essentially identical. This implies that it should be possible to improve the overall classification ability by combining the output from the two types of networks. For concreteness, we apply this technology to a signature of beyond the Standard Model physics to demonstrate that all these impressive features continue to hold in a scenario of relevance to the LHC.

(Machine) Learning to Improve the Empirical Performance of Discrete Algorithms                                                                                  This paper discusses a data-driven, empirically-based framework to make algorithmic decisions or recommendations without expert knowledge. We improve the performance of two algorithmic case studies: the selection of a pivot rule for the Simplex method and the selection of an all-pair shortest paths algorithm. We train machine learning methods to select the optimal algorithm for given data without human expert opinion. We use two types of techniques, neural networks and boosted decision trees. We concluded, based on our experiments, that: 1) Our selection framework recommends various pivot rules that improve overall total performance over just using a fixed default pivot rule. Over many years experts identified steepest-edge pivot rule as a favorite pivot rule. Our data analysis corroborates that the number of iterations by steepest-edge is no more than 4 percent more than the optimal selection which corroborates human expert knowledge, but this time the knowledge was obtained using machine learning. Here our recommendation system is best when using gradient boosted trees. 2) For the all-pairs shortest path problem, the models trained made a large improvement and our selection is on average .07 percent away from the optimal choice. The conclusions do not seem to be affected by the machine learning method we used. We tried to make a parallel analysis of both algorithmic problems, but it is clear that there are intrinsic differences. For example, in the all-pairs shortest path problem the graph density is a reasonable predictor, but there is no analogous single parameter for decisions in the Simplex method.

(More) Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Posterior Sampling                                                                                  Most provably-efficient learning algorithms introduce optimism about poorly-understood states and actions to encourage exploration. We study an alternative approach for efficient exploration, posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL). This algorithm proceeds in repeated episodes of known duration. At the start of each episode, PSRL updates a prior distribution over Markov decision processes and takes one sample from this posterior. PSRL then follows the policy that is optimal for this sample during the episode. The algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally efficient and allows an agent to encode prior knowledge in a natural way. We establish an $ tilde{O}( tau S sqrt{AT})$ bound on the expected regret, where $T$ is time, $ tau$ is the episode length and $S$ and $A$ are the cardinalities of the state and action spaces. This bound is one of the first for an algorithm not based on optimism, and close to the state of the art for any reinforcement learning algorithm. We show through simulation that PSRL significantly outperforms existing algorithms with similar regret bounds.

(Nearly) Optimal Algorithms for Private Online Learning in Full-information and Bandit Settings                                                                                  We provide a general technique for making online learning algorithms differentially private, in both the full information and bandit settings. Our technique applies to algorithms that aim to minimize a emph{convex} loss function which is a sum of smaller convex loss terms, one for each data point. We modify the popular emph{mirror descent} approach, or rather a variant called emph{follow the approximate leader}. The technique leads to the first nonprivate algorithms for private online learning in the bandit setting. In the full information setting, our algorithms improve over the regret bounds of previous work. In many cases, our algorithms (in both settings) matching the dependence on the input length, $T$, of the emph{optimal nonprivate} regret bounds up to logarithmic factors in $T$. Our algorithms require logarithmic space and update time.                                                                                  Abhradeep Guha Thakurta

Carefully configured neural networks are shown to be extremely strong authorship classifiers, so it is hoped that they might therefore teach `traditional' readers something about how the authors differ in style. Sadly their reasoning is, so far, inscrutable. While the overall goal has not yet been reached, this work reports some useful findings in terms of effective ways to encode and embed verse, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the neural network families, and useful (and not so useful) techniques for designing and inspecting NN models in this domain. This article suggests that, for poetry, CNNs are better choices than LSTMs -- they train more quickly, have equivalent accuracy, and (potentially) offer better interpretability. Based on a great deal of experimentation, it also suggests that simple, trainable embeddings are more effective than domain-specific schemes, and stresses the importance of techniques to reduce overfitting, like dropout and batch normalization.

(Quasi-)Real-Time Inversion of Airborne Time-Domain Electromagnetic Data via Artificial Neural Network                                                                                  The possibility to have results very quickly after, or even during, the collection of electromagnetic data would be important, not only for quality check purposes, but also for adjusting the location of the proposed flight lines during an airborne time-domain acquisition. This kind of readiness could have a large impact in terms of optimization of the Value of Information of the measurements to be acquired. In addition, the importance of having fast tools for retrieving resistivity models from airborne time-domain data is demonstrated by the fact that Conductivity-Depth Imaging methodologies are still the standard in mineral exploration. In fact, they are extremely computationally efficient, and, at the same time, they preserve a very high lateral resolution. For these reasons, they are often preferred to inversion strategies even if the latter approaches are generally more accurate in terms of proper reconstruction of the depth of the targets and of reliable retrieval of true resistivity values of the subsurface. In this research, we discuss a novel approach, based on neural network techniques, capable of retrieving resistivity models with a quality comparable with the inversion strategy, but in a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed novel approach on synthetic and field datasets.                                                                                  Andrea Viezzoli

(Re)$^2$H2O: Autonomous Driving Scenario Generation via Reversely Regularized Hybrid Offline-and-Online Reinforcement Learning                                                                                  Autonomous driving and its widespread adoption have long held tremendous promise. Nevertheless, without a trustworthy and thorough testing procedure, not only does the industry struggle to mass-produce autonomous vehicles (AV), but neither the general public nor policymakers are convinced to accept the innovations. Generating safety-critical scenarios that present significant challenges to AV is an essential first step in testing. Real-world datasets include naturalistic but overly safe driving behaviors, whereas simulation would allow for unrestricted exploration of diverse and aggressive traffic scenarios. Conversely, higher-dimensional searching space in simulation disables efficient scenario generation without real-world data distribution as implicit constraints. In order to marry the benefits of both, it seems appealing to learn to generate scenarios from both offline real-world and online simulation data simultaneously. Therefore, we tailor a Reversely Regularized Hybrid Offline-and-Online ((Re)$^2$H2O) Reinforcement Learning recipe to additionally penalize Q-values on real-world data and reward Q-values on simulated data, which ensures the generated scenarios are both varied and adversarial. Through extensive experiments, our solution proves to produce more risky scenarios than competitive baselines and it can generalize to work with various autonomous driving models. In addition, these generated scenarios are also corroborated to be capable of fine-tuning AV performance.                                                                                  Kun Ren

(Un)fair Exposure in Deep Face Rankings at a Distance                                                                                  Law enforcement regularly faces the challenge of ranking suspects from their facial images. Deep face models aid this process but frequently introduce biases that disproportionately affect certain demographic segments. While bias investigation is common in domains like job candidate ranking, the field of forensic face rankings remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel experimental framework, encompassing six state-of-the-art face encoders and two public data sets, designed to scrutinize the extent to which demographic groups suffer from biases in exposure in the context of forensic face rankings. Through comprehensive experiments that cover both re-identification and identification tasks, we show that exposure biases within this domain are far from being countered, demanding attention towards establishing ad-hoc policies and corrective measures.

(When) Are Contrastive Explanations of Reinforcement Learning Helpful?                                                                                  Global explanations of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent's expected behavior can make it safer to deploy. However, such explanations are often difficult to understand because of the complicated nature of many RL policies. Effective human explanations are often contrastive, referencing a known contrast (policy) to reduce redundancy. At the same time, these explanations also require the additional effort of referencing that contrast when evaluating an explanation. We conduct a user study to understand whether and when contrastive explanations might be preferable to complete explanations that do not require referencing a contrast. We find that complete explanations are generally more effective when they are the same size or smaller than a contrastive explanation of the same policy, and no worse when they are larger. This suggests that contrastive explanations are not sufficient to solve the problem of effectively explaining reinforcement learning policies, and require additional careful study for use in this context.

We conduct a user study to understand whether and when contrastive explanations might be preferable to complete explanations that do not require referencing a contrast. We find that complete explanations are generally more effective when they are the same size or smaller than a contrastive explanation of the same policy, and no worse when they are larger. This suggests that contrastive explanations are not sufficient to solve the problem of effectively explaining reinforcement learning policies, and require additional careful study for use in this context.

(When) Are Contrastive Explanations of Reinforcement Learning Helpful?                                                                                  Global explanations of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent's expected behavior can make it safer to deploy. However, such explanations are often difficult to understand because of the complicated nature of many RL policies. Effective human explanations are often contrastive, referencing a known contrast (policy) to reduce redundancy. At the same time, these explanations also require the additional effort of referencing that contrast when evaluating an explanation. We conduct a user study to understand whether and when contrastive explanations might be preferable to complete explanations that do not require referencing a contrast. We find that complete explanations are generally more effective when they are the same size or smaller than a contrastive explanation of the same policy, and no worse when they are larger.

*-CFQ: Analyzing the Scalability of Machine Learning on a Compositional Task                                                                                  We present *-CFQ ('star-CFQ'): a suite of large-scale datasets of varying scope based on the CFQ semantic parsing benchmark, designed for principled investigation of the scalability of machine learning systems in a realistic compositional task setting. Using this suite, we conduct a series of experiments investigating the ability of Transformers to benefit from increased training size under conditions of fixed computational cost. We show that compositional generalization remains a challenge at all training sizes, and we show that increasing the scope of natural language leads to consistently higher error rates, which are only partially offset by increased training data. We further show that while additional training data from a related domain improves the accuracy in data-starved situations, this improvement is limited and diminishes as the distance from the related domain to the target domain increases.

To demonstrate the sub-Nyquist level in our work, the conventional computational ghost imaging results, reconstructed imaging results using white noise and pink noise via deep learning are compared under multiple sampling rates at different noise conditions. We show that the proposed scheme can provide high-quality images with a sampling rate of 0.8% even when the object is outside the training dataset, and it is robust to noisy environments. This method is excellent for various applications, particularly those that require a low sampling rate, fast reconstruction efficiency, or experience strong noise interference.

As it counts 1 for positive variables and 0 for others, its intrinsic characteristics (e.g., discontinuity and no viable information of subgradients) impede its development for several decades. Even if there is an impressive body of work on designing DNNs with continuous activation functions that can be deemed as surrogates of the step function, it is still in the possession of some advantageous properties, such as complete robustness to outliers and being capable of attaining the best learning-theoretic guarantee of predictive accuracy. Hence, in this paper, we aim to train DNNs with the step function used as an activation function (dubbed as 0/1 DNNs). We first reformulate 0/1 DNNs as an unconstrained optimization problem and then solve it by a block coordinate descend (BCD) method. Moreover, we acquire closed-form solutions for sub-problems of BCD as well as its convergence properties. Furthermore, we also integrate $ ell_{2,0}$-regularization into 0/1 DNN to accelerate the training process and compress the network scale. As a result, the proposed algorithm has a high performance on classifying MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

1-Bit Compressive Sensing for Efficient Federated Learning Over the Air                                                                                  For distributed learning among collaborative users, this paper develops and analyzes a communication-efficient scheme for federated learning (FL) over the air, which incorporates 1-bit compressive sensing (CS) into analog aggregation transmissions. To facilitate design parameter optimization, we theoretically analyze the efficacy of the proposed scheme by deriving a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate of the FL over the air. Our theoretical results reveal the tradeoff between convergence performance and communication efficiency as a result of the aggregation errors caused by sparsification, dimension reduction, quantization, signal reconstruction and noise. Then, we formulate 1-bit CS based FL over the air as a joint optimization problem to mitigate the impact of these aggregation errors through joint optimal design of worker scheduling and power scaling policy. An enumeration-based method is proposed to solve this non-convex problem, which is optimal but becomes computationally infeasible as the number of devices increases. For scalable computing, we resort to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to develop an efficient implementation that is suitable for large-scale networks. Simulation results show that our proposed 1-bit CS based FL over the air achieves comparable performance to the ideal case where conventional FL without compression and quantification is applied over error-free aggregation, at much reduced communication overhead and transmission latency.

An enumeration-based method is proposed to solve this non-convex problem, which is optimal but becomes computationally infeasible as the number of devices increases. For scalable computing, we resort to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to develop an efficient implementation that is suitable for large-scale networks. Simulation results show that our proposed 1-bit CS based FL over the air achieves comparable performance to the ideal case where conventional FL without compression and quantification is applied over error-free aggregation, at much reduced communication overhead and transmission latency.

1-D Convlutional Neural Networks for the Analysis of Pupil Size Variations in Scotopic Conditions                                                                                  It is well known that a systematic analysis of the pupil size variations, recorded by means of an eye-tracker, is a rich source of information about a subject's arousal and cognitive state. Current methods for pupil analysis are limited to descriptive statistics, struggle in handling the wide inter-subjects variability and must be coupled with a long series of pre-processing signal operations. In this we present a data-driven approach in which 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks are applied directly to the raw pupil size data. To test its effectiveness, we apply our method in a binary classification task with two different groups of subjects: a group of elderly patients with Parkinson disease (PDs), a condition in which pupil abnormalities have been extensively reported, and a group of healthy adults subjects (HCs). Long-range registration (10 minutes) of the pupil size were collected in scotopic conditions (complete darkness, 0 lux). 1-D convolutional neural network models are trained for classification of short-range sequences (10 to 60 seconds of registration). The model provides prediction with high average accuracy on a hold out test set. Dataset and codes are released for reproducibility and benchmarking purposes.                                                                                  Alessandra Rufa

1-D Residual Convolutional Neural Network coupled with Data Augmentation and Regularization for the ICPHM 2023 Data Challenge                                                                                  In this article, we present our contribution to the ICPHM 2023 Data Challenge on Industrial Systems' Health Monitoring using Vibration Analysis. For the task of classifying sun gear faults in a gearbox, we propose a residual Convolutional Neural Network that operates on raw three-channel time-domain vibration signals. In conjunction with data augmentation and regularization techniques, the proposed model yields very good results in a multi-class classification scenario with real-world data despite its relatively small size, i.e., with less than 30,000 trainable parameters. Even when presented with data obtained from multiple operating conditions, the network is still capable to accurately predict the condition of the gearbox under inspection.

1-Dimensional polynomial neural networks for audio signal related problems                                                                                  In addition to being extremely non-linear, modern problems require millions if not billions of parameters to solve or at least to get a good approximation of the solution, and neural networks are known to assimilate that complexity by deepening and widening their topology in order to increase the level of non-linearity needed for a better approximation. However, compact topologies are always preferred to deeper ones as they offer the advantage of using less computational units and less parameters. This compacity comes at the price of reduced non-linearity and thus, of limited solution search space. We propose the 1-Dimensional Polynomial Neural Network (1DPNN) model that uses automatic polynomial kernel estimation for 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1DCNNs) and that introduces a high degree of non-linearity from the first layer which can compensate the need for deep and/or wide topologies. We show that this non-linearity enables the model to yield better results with less computational and spatial complexity than a regular 1DCNN on various classification and regression problems related to audio signals, even though it introduces more computational and spatial complexity on a neuronal level. The experiments were conducted on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate that, on the problems that were tackled, the proposed model can extract more relevant information from the data than a 1DCNN in less time and with less memory.

1-Lipschitz Neural Networks are more expressive with N-Activations                                                                                  A crucial property for achieving secure, trustworthy and interpretable deep learning systems is their robustness: small changes to a system's inputs should not result in large changes to its outputs. Mathematically, this means one strives for networks with a small Lipschitz constant. Several recent works have focused on how to construct such Lipschitz networks, typically by imposing constraints on the weight matrices. In this work, we study an orthogonal aspect, namely the role of the activation function. We show that commonly used activation functions, such as MaxMin, as well as all piece-wise linear ones with two segments unnecessarily restrict the class of representable functions, even in the simplest one-dimensional setting. We furthermore introduce the new N-activation function that is provably more expressive than currently popular activation functions. We provide code at https://github.com/berndprach/NActivation.                                                                                  Bernd Prach

1-bit Quantized On-chip Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network Enabled by Authentic All-optical Fully-connected Architecture                                                                                  Optical Diffraction Neural Networks (DNNs), a subset of Optical Neural Networks (ONNs), show promise in mirroring the prowess of electronic networks. This study introduces the Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network (HDNN), a novel architecture that incorporates matrix multiplication into DNNs, synergizing the benefits of conventional ONNs with those of DNNs to surmount the modulation limitations inherent in optical diffraction neural networks. Utilizing a singular phase modulation layer and an amplitude modulation layer, the trained neural network demonstrated remarkable accuracies of 96.39% and 89% in digit recognition tasks in simulation and experiment, respectively. Additionally, we develop the Binning Design (BD) method, which effectively mitigates the constraints imposed by sampling intervals on diffraction units, substantially streamlining experimental procedures. Furthermore, we propose an on-chip HDNN that not only employs a beam-splitting phase modulation layer for enhanced integration level but also significantly relaxes device fabrication requirements, replacing metasurfaces with relief surfaces designed by 1-bit quantization. Besides, we conceptualized an all-optical HDNN-assisted lesion detection network, achieving detection outcomes that were 100% aligned with simulation predictions.

1-bit Quantized On-chip Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network Enabled by Authentic All-optical Fully-connected Architecture                                                                                  Optical Diffraction Neural Networks (DNNs), a subset of Optical Neural Networks (ONNs), show promise in mirroring the prowess of electronic networks. This study introduces the Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network (HDNN), a novel architecture that incorporates matrix multiplication into DNNs, synergizing the benefits of conventional ONNs with those of DNNs to surmount the modulation limitations inherent in optical diffraction neural networks. Utilizing a singular phase modulation layer and an amplitude modulation layer, the trained neural network demonstrated remarkable accuracies of 96.39% and 89% in digit recognition tasks in simulation and experiment, respectively. Additionally, we develop the Binning Design (BD) method, which effectively mitigates the constraints imposed by sampling intervals on diffraction units, substantially streamlining experimental procedures. Furthermore, we propose an on-chip HDNN that not only employs a beam-splitting phase modulation layer for enhanced integration level but also significantly relaxes device fabrication requirements, replacing metasurfaces with relief surfaces designed by 1-bit quantization. Besides, we conceptualized an all-optical HDNN-assisted lesion detection network, achieving detection outcomes that were 100% aligned with simulation predictions. This work not only advances the performance of DNNs but also streamlines the path towards industrial optical neural network production.

10,000 optimal CVRP solutions for testing machine learning based heuristics                                                                                  We introduce a benchmark of 10,000 instances with heterogeneous characteristics for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. We also provide optimal solutions for almost all of them along with a generator to produce additional training and validation data. This benchmark aims to permit a more systematic comparison of machine learning based search algorithms on this important problem. We also emit recommendations regarding the correct use of this dataset.                                                                                  Anonymous
1000 Pupil Segmentations in a Second using Haar Like Features and Statistical Learning                                                                                  In this paper we present a new approach for pupil segmentation. It can be computed and trained very efficiently, making it ideal for online use for high speed eye trackers as well as for energy saving pupil detection in mobile eye tracking. The approach is inspired by the BORE and CBF algorithms and generalizes the binary comparison by Haar features. Since these features are intrinsically very susceptible to noise and fluctuating light conditions, we combine them with conditional pupil shape probabilities. In addition, we also rank each feature according to its importance in determining the pupil shape. Another advantage of our method is the use of statistical learning, which is very efficient and can even be used online. https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/seafile/d/8e2ab8c3fdd444e1a135/?p=%2FStatsPupil&mode=list                                                                                  Wolfgang Fuhl
11 Summaries of Papers on Explainable Reinforcement Learning With Some Commentary                                                                                  Model interpretability was a bullet point in Concrete Problems in AI Safety (2016). Since then, interpretability has come to comprise entire research directions in technical safety agendas (2020). It is safe to say that interpretability is now a very popular area of research. In fact, the topic is sufficiently mainstream that there are books on the topic and corporate services promising to provide it. Interpretability for reinforcement learning, however, has received much less attention than for supervised learning. So what's the state of research on this topic? What does progress in interpretable RL look like, and are we making progress? What is this post? This post summarizes 11 recent papers on explaining reinforcement learning agents (in ICLR and related conferences), then provides commentary on the research. The summaries - and not the commentary - are the main point of this post. Though people like paper summaries, this is the kind of interpretive labor that isn't traditionally awarded space in research venues. We primarily select papers appearing between 2018 and 2020, in order to bridge the gap between foundational papers published in 2010-2017 and the more recent and diverse directions of research in the field.

They are of significant interest for machine learning tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, playing board games and medical diagnosis. Optical neural networks offer the promise of dramatically accelerating computing speed to overcome the inherent bandwidth bottleneck of electronics. Here, we demonstrate a universal optical vector convolutional accelerator operating beyond 10 TeraFLOPS (floating point operations per second), generating convolutions of images of 250,000 pixels with 8 bit resolution for 10 kernels simultaneously, enough for facial image recognition. We then use the same hardware to sequentially form a deep optical CNN with ten output neurons, achieving successful recognition of full 10 digits with 900 pixel handwritten digit images with 88% accuracy. Our results are based on simultaneously interleaving temporal, wavelength and spatial dimensions enabled by an integrated microcomb source. This approach is scalable and trainable to much more complex networks for demanding applications such as unmanned vehicle and real-time video recognition.

12 mJ per Class On-Device Online Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning                                                                                  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) enables machine learning systems to expand their inference capabilities to new classes using only a few labeled examples, without forgetting the previously learned classes. Classical backpropagation-based learning and its variants are often unsuitable for battery-powered, memory-constrained systems at the extreme edge. In this work, we introduce Online Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (O-FSCIL), based on a lightweight model consisting of a pretrained and metalearned feature extractor and an expandable explicit memory storing the class prototypes. The architecture is pretrained with a novel feature orthogonality regularization and metalearned with a multi-margin loss. For learning a new class, our approach extends the explicit memory with novel class prototypes, while the remaining architecture is kept frozen.

Classical backpropagation-based learning and its variants are often unsuitable for battery-powered, memory-constrained systems at the extreme edge. In this work, we introduce Online Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (O-FSCIL), based on a lightweight model consisting of a pretrained and metalearned feature extractor and an expandable explicit memory storing the class prototypes. The architecture is pretrained with a novel feature orthogonality regularization and metalearned with a multi-margin loss. For learning a new class, our approach extends the explicit memory with novel class prototypes, while the remaining architecture is kept frozen.

12-in-1: Multi-Task Vision and Language Representation Learning                                                                                  Much of vision-and-language research focuses on a small but diverse set of independent tasks and supporting datasets often studied in isolation; however, the visually-grounded language understanding skills required for success at these tasks overlap significantly. In this work, we investigate these relationships between vision-and-language tasks by developing a large-scale, multi-task training regime. Our approach culminates in a single model on 12 datasets from four broad categories of task including visual question answering, caption-based image retrieval, grounding referring expressions, and multi-modal verification. Compared to independently trained single-task models, this represents a reduction from approximately 3 billion parameters to 270 million while simultaneously improving performance by 2.05 points on average across tasks. We use our multi-task framework to perform in-depth analysis of the effect of joint training diverse tasks. Further, we show that finetuning task-specific models from our single multi-task model can lead to further improvements, achieving performance at or above the state-of-the-art.

1D Convolutional Neural Network Models for Sleep Arousal Detection                                                                                  Sleep arousals transition the depth of sleep to a more superficial stage. The occurrence of such events is often considered as a protective mechanism to alert the body of harmful stimuli. Thus, accurate sleep arousal detection can lead to an enhanced understanding of the underlying causes and influencing the assessment of sleep quality. Previous studies and guidelines have suggested that sleep arousals are linked mainly to abrupt frequency shifts in EEG signals, but the proposed rules are shown to be insufficient for a comprehensive characterization of arousals. This study investigates the application of five recent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sleep arousal detection and performs comparative evaluations to determine the best model for this task. The investigated state-of-the-art CNN models have originally been designed for image or speech processing. A detailed set of evaluations is performed on the benchmark dataset provided by PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2018, and the results show that the best 1D CNN model has achieved an average of 0.31 and 0.84 for the area under the precision-recall and area under the ROC curves, respectively.

1D Convolutional Neural Networks and Applications: A Survey                                                                                  During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application-specific.

1D Convolutional neural networks and machine learning algorithms for spectral data classification with a case study for Covid-19                                                                                  Machine and deep learning algorithms have increasingly been applied to solve problems in various areas of knowledge. Among these areas, Chemometrics has been benefited from the application of these algorithms in spectral data analysis. Commonly, algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Partial Least Squares are applied to spectral datasets to perform classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we present a 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) to evaluate the effectiveness on spectral data obtained from spectroscopy. In most cases, the spectrum signals are noisy and present overlap among classes. Firstly, we perform extensive experiments including 1D-CNN compared to machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms used in Chemometrics on spectral data classification for the most known datasets available in the literature. Next, spectral samples of the SARS-COV2 virus, which causes the COVID-19, have recently been collected via spectroscopy was used as a case study. Experimental results indicate superior performance of 1D-CNN over machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms, obtaining an average accuracy of 96.5%, specificity of 98%, and sensitivity of 94%. The promissing obtained results indicate the feasibility to use 1D-CNN in automated systems to diagnose COVID-19 and other viral diseases in the future.

1D-CapsNet-LSTM: A Deep Learning-Based Model for Multi-Step Stock Index Forecasting                                                                                  Multi-step stock index forecasting is vital in finance for informed decision-making. Current forecasting methods on this task frequently produce unsatisfactory results due to the inherent data randomness and instability, thereby underscoring the demand for advanced forecasting models. Given the superiority of capsule network (CapsNet) over CNN in various forecasting and classification tasks, this study investigates the potential of integrating a 1D CapsNet with an LSTM network for multi-step stock index forecasting. To this end, a hybrid 1D-CapsNet-LSTM model is introduced, which utilizes a 1D CapsNet to generate high-level capsules from sequential data and a LSTM network to capture temporal dependencies. To maintain stochastic dependencies over different forecasting horizons, a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategy is employed. The model's performance is evaluated on real-world stock market indices, including S&P 500, DJIA, IXIC, and NYSE, and compared to baseline models, including LSTM, RNN, and CNN-LSTM, using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and TIC. The proposed 1D-CapsNet-LSTM model consistently outperforms baseline models in two key aspects. It exhibits significant reductions in forecasting errors compared to baseline models. Furthermore, it displays a slower rate of error increase with lengthening forecast horizons, indicating increased robustness for multi-step forecasting tasks.

1DFormer: Learning 1D Landmark Representations via Transformer for Facial Landmark Tracking                                                                                  Recently, heatmap regression methods based on 1D landmark representations have shown prominent performance on locating facial landmarks. However, previous methods ignored to make deep explorations on the good potentials of 1D landmark representations for sequential and structural modeling of multiple landmarks to track facial landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose a Transformer architecture, namely 1DFormer, which learns informative 1D landmark representations by capturing the dynamic and the geometric patterns of landmarks via token communications in both temporal and spatial dimensions for facial landmark tracking. For temporal modeling, we propose a recurrent token mixing mechanism, an axis-landmark-positional embedding mechanism, as well as a confidence-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism to adaptively and robustly embed long-term landmark dynamics into their 1D representations; for structure modeling, we design intra-group and inter-group structure modeling mechanisms to encode the component-level as well as global-level facial structure patterns as a refinement for the 1D representations of landmarks through token communications in the spatial dimension via 1D convolutional layers. Experimental results on the 300VW and the TF databases show that 1DFormer successfully models the long-range sequential patterns as well as the inherent facial structures to learn informative 1D representations of landmark sequences, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on facial landmark tracking.

1DFormer: Learning 1D Landmark Representations via Transformer for Facial Landmark Tracking                                                                                  Recently, heatmap regression methods based on 1D landmark representations have shown prominent performance on locating facial landmarks. However, previous methods ignored to make deep explorations on the good potentials of 1D landmark representations for sequential and structural modeling of multiple landmarks to track facial landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose a Transformer architecture, namely 1DFormer, which learns informative 1D landmark representations by capturing the dynamic and the geometric patterns of landmarks via token communications in both temporal and spatial dimensions for facial landmark tracking. For temporal modeling, we propose a recurrent token mixing mechanism, an axis-landmark-positional embedding mechanism, as well as a confidence-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism to adaptively and robustly embed long-term landmark dynamics into their 1D representations; for structure modeling, we design intra-group and inter-group structure modeling mechanisms to encode the component-level as well as global-level facial structure patterns as a refinement for the 1D representations of landmarks through token communications in the spatial dimension via 1D convolutional layers. Experimental results on the 300VW and the TF databases show that 1DFormer successfully models the long-range sequential patterns as well as the inherent facial structures to learn informative 1D representations of landmark sequences, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on facial landmark tracking.

To tackle this task in ImageNet-100, we describe a simple yet effective resource-aware backbone search framework composed of profile and instantiation phases. In addition, we employ multi-resolution ensembles to boost inference accuracy on limited resources. The profile phase obeys time and memory constraints to determine the models' optimal batch-size, max epochs, and automatic mixed precision (AMP). And the instantiation phase trains models with the determined parameters from the profile phase. For improving intra-domain generalizations, the multi-resolution ensembles are formed by two-resolution images with randomly applied flips. We present a comprehensive analysis with expensive experiments. Based on our approach, we win first place in International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2023 Workshop Challenge Track 1 on Resource Efficient Deep Learning for Computer Vision (RCV).

1xN Pattern for Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks                                                                                  Though network pruning receives popularity in reducing the complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it remains an open issue to concurrently maintain model accuracy as well as achieve significant speedups on general CPUs. In this paper, we propose a novel 1xN pruning pattern to break this limitation. In particular, consecutive N output kernels with the same input channel index are grouped into one block, which serves as a basic pruning granularity of our pruning pattern. Our 1xN pattern prunes these blocks considered unimportant. We also provide a workflow of filter rearrangement that first rearranges the weight matrix in the output channel dimension to derive more influential blocks for accuracy improvements and then applies similar rearrangement to the next-layer weights in the input channel dimension to ensure correct convolutional operations. Moreover, the output computation after our 1xN pruning can be realized via a parallelized block-wise vectorized operation, leading to significant speedups on general CPUs. The efficacy of our pruning pattern is proved with experiments on ILSVRC-2012. For example, given the pruning rate of 50% and N=4, our pattern obtains about 3.0% improvements over filter pruning in the top-1 accuracy of MobileNet-V2. Meanwhile, it obtains 56.04ms inference savings on Cortex-A7 CPU over weight pruning.

1xN Pattern for Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks                                                                                  Though network pruning receives popularity in reducing the complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it remains an open issue to concurrently maintain model accuracy as well as achieve significant speedups on general CPUs. In this paper, we propose a novel 1xN pruning pattern to break this limitation. In particular, consecutive N output kernels with the same input channel index are grouped into one block, which serves as a basic pruning granularity of our pruning pattern. Our 1xN pattern prunes these blocks considered unimportant. We also provide a workflow of filter rearrangement that first rearranges the weight matrix in the output channel dimension to derive more influential blocks for accuracy improvements and then applies similar rearrangement to the next-layer weights in the input channel dimension to ensure correct convolutional operations. Moreover, the output computation after our 1xN pruning can be realized via a parallelized block-wise vectorized operation, leading to significant speedups on general CPUs.

2-Level Reinforcement Learning for Ships on Inland Waterways                                                                                  This paper proposes a realistic modularized framework for controlling autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) on inland waterways (IWs) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The framework comprises two levels: a high-level local path planning (LPP) unit and a low-level path following (PF) unit, each consisting of a DRL agent. The LPP agent is responsible for planning a path under consideration of nearby vessels, traffic rules, and the geometry of the waterway. We thereby leverage a recently proposed spatial-temporal recurrent neural network architecture, which is transferred to continuous action spaces. The PF agent is responsible for low-level actuator control while accounting for shallow water influences on the marine craft and the environmental forces winds, waves, and currents. Both agents are thoroughly validated in simulation, employing the lower Elbe in northern Germany as an example case and using real AIS trajectories to model the behavior of other ships.

We thereby transfer a recently proposed spatial-temporal recurrent neural network architecture to continuous action spaces.

The PF agent performs low-level actuator control while accounting for shallow water influences and the environmental forces winds, waves, and currents. Compared with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, the PF agent yields only 61% of the mean cross-track error while significantly reducing control effort in terms of the required absolute rudder angle.

2-bit Model Compression of Deep Convolutional Neural Network on ASIC Engine for Image Retrieval                                                                                  Image retrieval utilizes image descriptors to retrieve the most similar images to a given query image. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is becoming the dominant approach to extract image descriptors for image retrieval. For low-power hardware implementation of image retrieval, the drawback of CNN-based feature descriptor is that it requires hundreds of megabytes of storage. To address this problem, this paper applies deep model quantization and compression to CNN in ASIC chip for image retrieval. It is demonstrated that the CNN-based features descriptor can be extracted using as few as 2-bit weights quantization to deliver a similar performance as floating-point model for image retrieval. In addition, to implement CNN in ASIC, especially for large scale images, the limited buffer size of chips should be considered. To retrieve large scale images, we propose an improved pooling strategy, region nested invariance pooling (RNIP), which uses cropped sub-images for CNN. Testing results on chip show that integrating RNIP with the proposed 2-bit CNN model compression approach is capable of retrieving large scale images.

2-bit Model Compression of Deep Convolutional Neural Network on ASIC Engine for Image Retrieval                                                                                  Image retrieval utilizes image descriptors to retrieve the most similar images to a given query image. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is becoming the dominant approach to extract image descriptors for image retrieval. For low-power hardware implementation of image retrieval, the drawback of CNN-based feature descriptor is that it requires hundreds of megabytes of storage. To address this problem, this paper applies deep model quantization and compression to CNN in ASIC chip for image retrieval. It is demonstrated that the CNN-based features descriptor can be extracted using as few as 2-bit weights quantization to deliver a similar performance as floating-point model for image retrieval. In addition, to implement CNN in ASIC, especially for large scale images, the limited buffer size of chips should be considered. To retrieve large scale images, we propose an improved pooling strategy, region nested invariance pooling (RNIP), which uses cropped sub-images for CNN. Testing results on chip show that integrating RNIP with the proposed 2-bit CNN model compression approach is capable of retrieving large scale images.

2-gram-based Phonetic Feature Generation for Convolutional Neural Network in Assessment of Trademark Similarity                                                                                  A trademark is a mark used to identify various commodities. If same or similar trademark is registered for the same or similar commodity, the purchaser of the goods may be confused. Therefore, in the process of trademark registration examination, the examiner judges whether the trademark is the same or similar to the other applied or registered trademarks. The confusion in trademarks is based on the visual, phonetic or conceptual similarity of the marks. In this paper, we focus specifically on the phonetic similarity between trademarks. We propose a method to generate 2D phonetic feature for convolutional neural network in assessment of trademark similarity. This proposed algorithm is tested with 12,553 trademark phonetic similar pairs and 34,020 trademark phonetic non-similar pairs from 2010 to 2016. As a result, we have obtained approximately 92% judgment accuracy.                                                                                  Gun Hong Park

2-hop Neighbor Class Similarity (2NCS): A graph structural metric indicative of graph neural network performance                                                                                  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on graph-structured data across numerous domains. Their underlying ability to represent nodes as summaries of their vicinities has proven effective for homophilous graphs in particular, in which same-type nodes tend to connect. On heterophilous graphs, in which different-type nodes are likely connected, GNNs perform less consistently, as neighborhood information might be less representative or even misleading. On the other hand, GNN performance is not inferior on all heterophilous graphs, and there is a lack of understanding of what other graph properties affect GNN performance. In this work, we highlight the limitations of the widely used homophily ratio and the recent Cross-Class Neighborhood Similarity (CCNS) metric in estimating GNN performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce 2-hop Neighbor Class Similarity (2NCS), a new quantitative graph structural property that correlates with GNN performance more strongly and consistently than alternative metrics. 2NCS considers two-hop neighborhoods as a theoretically derived consequence of the two-step label propagation process governing GCN's training-inference process. Experiments on one synthetic and eight real-world graph datasets confirm consistent improvements over existing metrics in estimating the accuracy of GCN- and GAT-based architectures on the node classification task.

2.5D Deep Learning for CT Image Reconstruction using a Multi-GPU implementation                                                                                  While Model Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) of CT scans has been shown to have better image quality than Filtered Back Projection (FBP), its use has been limited by its high computational cost. More recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown great promise in both denoising and reconstruction applications. In this research, we propose a fast reconstruction algorithm, which we call Deep Learning MBIR (DL-MBIR), for approximating MBIR using a deep residual neural network. The DL-MBIR method is trained to produce reconstructions that approximate true MBIR images using a 16 layer residual convolutional neural network implemented on multiple GPUs using Google Tensorflow. In addition, we propose 2D, 2.5D and 3D variations on the DL-MBIR method and show that the 2.5D method achieves similar quality to the fully 3D method, but with reduced computational cost.                                                                                  
2.75D: Boosting Learning Efficiency and Capability by Representing 3D Features in 2D                                                                                  In medical imaging, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown superior performance to 2D CNN in numerous deep learning tasks with high dimensional input, proving the added value of 3D spatial information in feature representation. However, 3D CNN requires more training samples to converge, and more computational resources and execution time for both training and inference. Meanwhile, applying transfer learning on 3D CNN is challenging due to a lack of publicly available pre-trained 3D networks. To tackle with these issues, we propose a novel 2D strategical representation of volumetric data, namely 2.75D approach. In our method, the spatial information of 3D images was captured in a single 2D view by a spiral-spinning technique. Therefore, our CNN is intrinsically a 2D network, which can fully leverage pre-trained 2D CNNs for downstream vision problems. We evaluated the proposed method on LUNA16 nodule detection challenge, by comparing the proposed 2.75D method with 2D, 2.5D, 3D counterparts in the nodule false positive reduction. Results show that the proposed method outperforms other counterparts when all methods were trained from scratch. Such performance gain is more pronounced when introducing transfer learning or when training data is limited. In addition, our method achieves a substantial reduce in time consumption of training and inference comparing with the 3D method. Our code will be publicly available.                                                                                  Ruisheng Su

Besides, we can fully leverage pre-trained 2D CNNs for downstream vision problems. We also explore a multi-view 2.75D strategy, 2.75D 3 channels (2.75Dx3), to boost the advantage of 2.75D. We evaluated the proposed methods on three public datasets with different modalities or organs (Lung CT, Breast MRI, and Prostate MRI), against their 2D, 2.5D, and 3D counterparts in classification tasks. Results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform other counterparts when all methods were trained from scratch on the lung dataset. Such performance gain is more pronounced with transfer learning or in the case of limited training data. Our methods also achieved comparable performance on other datasets. In addition, our methods achieved a substantial reduction in time consumption of training and inference compared with the 2.5D or 3D method.

20-fold Accelerated 7T fMRI Using Referenceless Self-Supervised Deep Learning Reconstruction                                                                                  High spatial and temporal resolution across the whole brain is essential to accurately resolve neural activities in fMRI. Therefore, accelerated imaging techniques target improved coverage with high spatio-temporal resolution. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging combined with in-plane acceleration are used in large studies that involve ultrahigh field fMRI, such as the Human Connectome Project. However, for even higher acceleration rates, these methods cannot be reliably utilized due to aliasing and noise artifacts. Deep learning (DL) reconstruction techniques have recently gained substantial interest for improving highly-accelerated MRI. Supervised learning of DL reconstructions generally requires fully-sampled training datasets, which is not available for high-resolution fMRI studies. To tackle this challenge, self-supervised learning has been proposed for training of DL reconstruction with only undersampled datasets, showing similar performance to supervised learning. In this study, we utilize a self-supervised physics-guided DL reconstruction on a 5-fold SMS and 4-fold in-plane accelerated 7T fMRI data. Our results show that our self-supervised DL reconstruction produce high-quality images at this 20-fold acceleration, substantially improving on existing methods, while showing similar functional precision and temporal effects in the subsequent analysis compared to a standard 10-fold accelerated acquisition.

200x Low-dose PET Reconstruction using Deep Learning                                                                                  Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used in various clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, heart disease and neuro disorders. The use of radioactive tracer in PET imaging raises concerns due to the risk of radiation exposure. To minimize this potential risk in PET imaging, efforts have been made to reduce the amount of radio-tracer usage. However, lowing dose results in low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and loss of information, both of which will heavily affect clinical diagnosis. Besides, the ill-conditioning of low-dose PET image reconstruction makes it a difficult problem for iterative reconstruction algorithms. Previous methods proposed are typically complicated and slow, yet still cannot yield satisfactory results at significantly low dose. Here, we propose a deep learning method to resolve this issue with an encoder-decoder residual deep network with concatenate skip connections. Experiments shows the proposed method can reconstruct low-dose PET image to a standard-dose quality with only two-hundredth dose. Different cost functions for training model are explored. Multi-slice input strategy is introduced to provide the network with more structural information and make it more robust to noise. Evaluation on ultra-low-dose clinical data shows that the proposed method can achieve better result than the state-of-the-art methods and reconstruct images with comparable quality using only 0.5% of the original regular dose.

200x Low-dose PET Reconstruction using Deep Learning                                                                                  Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used in various clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, heart disease and neuro disorders. The use of radioactive tracer in PET imaging raises concerns due to the risk of radiation exposure. To minimize this potential risk in PET imaging, efforts have been made to reduce the amount of radio-tracer usage. However, lowing dose results in low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and loss of information, both of which will heavily affect clinical diagnosis. Besides, the ill-conditioning of low-dose PET image reconstruction makes it a difficult problem for iterative reconstruction algorithms. Previous methods proposed are typically complicated and slow, yet still cannot yield satisfactory results at significantly low dose.

2021 BEETL Competition: Advancing Transfer Learning for Subject Independence & Heterogenous EEG Data Sets                                                                                  Transfer learning and meta-learning offer some of the most promising avenues to unlock the scalability of healthcare and consumer technologies driven by biosignal data. This is because current methods cannot generalise well across human subjects' data and handle learning from different heterogeneously collected data sets, thus limiting the scale of training data. On the other side, developments in transfer learning would benefit significantly from a real-world benchmark with immediate practical application. Therefore, we pick electroencephalography (EEG) as an exemplar for what makes biosignal machine learning hard. We design two transfer learning challenges around diagnostics and Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI), that have to be solved in the face of low signal-to-noise ratios, major variability among subjects, differences in the data recording sessions and techniques, and even between the specific BCI tasks recorded in the dataset. Task 1 is centred on the field of medical diagnostics, addressing automatic sleep stage annotation across subjects. Task 2 is centred on Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI), addressing motor imagery decoding across both subjects and data sets. The BEETL competition with its over 30 competing teams and its 3 winning entries brought attention to the potential of deep transfer learning and combinations of set theory and conventional machine learning techniques to overcome the challenges. The results set a new state-of-the-art for the real-world BEETL benchmark.                                                                                  Xiaoxi Wei

Therefore, we pick electroencephalography (EEG) as an exemplar for what makes biosignal machine learning hard. We design two transfer learning challenges around diagnostics and Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI), that have to be solved in the face of low signal-to-noise ratios, major variability among subjects, differences in the data recording sessions and techniques, and even between the specific BCI tasks recorded in the dataset. Task 1 is centred on the field of medical diagnostics, addressing automatic sleep stage annotation across subjects. Task 2 is centred on Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI), addressing motor imagery decoding across both subjects and data sets. The BEETL competition with its over 30 competing teams and its 3 winning entries brought attention to the potential of deep transfer learning and combinations of set theory and conventional machine learning techniques to overcome the challenges. The results set a new state-of-the-art for the real-world BEETL benchmark.                                                                                  A. Aldo Faisal

2CP: Decentralized Protocols to Transparently Evaluate Contributivity in Blockchain Federated Learning Environments                                                                                  Federated Learning harnesses data from multiple sources to build a single model. While the initial model might belong solely to the actor bringing it to the network for training, determining the ownership of the trained model resulting from Federated Learning remains an open question. In this paper we explore how Blockchains (in particular Ethereum) can be used to determine the evolving ownership of a model trained with Federated Learning. Firstly, we use the step-by-step evaluation metric to assess the relative contributivities of participants in a Federated Learning process. Next, we introduce 2CP, a framework comprising two novel protocols for Blockchained Federated Learning, which both reward contributors with shares in the final model based on their relative contributivity. The Crowdsource Protocol allows an actor to bring a model forward for training, and use their own data to evaluate the contributions made to it. Potential trainers are guaranteed a fair share of the resulting model, even in a trustless setting. The Consortium Protocol gives trainers the same guarantee even when no party owns the initial model and no evaluator is available. We conduct experiments with the MNIST dataset that reveal sound contributivity scores resulting from both Protocols by rewarding larger datasets with greater shares in the model. Our experiments also showed the necessity to pair 2CP with a robust model aggregation mechanism to discard low quality inputs coming from model poisoning attacks.

2D Convolutional Neural Network for Event Reconstruction in IceCube DeepCore                                                                                  IceCube DeepCore is an extension of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory designed to measure GeV scale atmospheric neutrino interactions for the purpose of neutrino oscillation studies. Distinguishing muon neutrinos from other flavors and reconstructing inelasticity are especially difficult tasks at GeV scale energies in IceCube DeepCore due to sparse instrumentation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been found to have better success at neutrino event reconstruction than conventional likelihood-based methods. In this contribution, we present a new CNN model that exploits time and depth translational symmetry in IceCube DeepCore data and present the model's performance, specifically for flavor identification and inelasticity reconstruction.

2D Convolutional Neural Networks for 3D Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Classification                                                                                  Automated methods for breast cancer detection have focused on 2D mammography and have largely ignored 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), which is frequently used in clinical practice. The two key challenges in developing automated methods for DBT classification are handling the variable number of slices and retaining slice-to-slice changes. We propose a novel deep 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for DBT classification that simultaneously overcomes both challenges. Our approach operates on the full volume, regardless of the number of slices, and allows the use of pre-trained 2D CNNs for feature extraction, which is important given the limited amount of annotated training data. In an extensive evaluation on a real-world clinical dataset, our approach achieves 0.854 auROC, which is 28.80% higher than approaches based on 3D CNNs. We also find that these improvements are stable across a range of model configurations.                                                                                  Hunter Blanton
